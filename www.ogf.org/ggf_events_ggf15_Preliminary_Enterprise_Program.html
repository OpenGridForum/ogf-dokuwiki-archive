                              <p>In today's dynamic business environment, enterprises 
                                around the world are aggressively working horizontally 
                                across organizational and geographic boundaries 
                                to delivery greater customer value and competitive 
                                advantage. CIO's are challenged to increase the 
                                business value of their IT services and enable 
                                integration with customers, suppliers and partners. 
                                The opportunity is to deliver IT as a flexible 
                                service to the business while continuing to reducing 
                                costs through better resource utilization and 
                                increased automation. As large commercial enterprises 
                                transition from vertical silos to horizontally-integrated 
                                infrastructure and applications they are adopting 
                                grid solutions that enable industry collaboration 
                                while providing flexible, cost-efficient solutions 
                                for informational integration and resource sharing. 
                                In his opening keynote at GridWorld, Gary Beach 
                                from CIO Magazine will discuss the global business 
                                trends helping to shape next generation Enterprise 
                                IT. He will explore the 10 reasons IT professionals 
                                are adopting grid technologies to enable business 
                                advantage. In the process, Gary will help frame 
                                the interactive discussion between participants 
                                at GridWorld as they discuss the business case 
                                and roadmap for successful grid adoption within 
                                the Enterprise.</p>

                                How do I start applying Grid technology? This 
                                is a very natural question being raised today 
                                by many global enterprises, which are hearing 
                                about the widely reported, tangible benefits of 
                                Grid, but have not yet begun to apply the technology. 
                                Since Grid solutions, building blocks and standards 
                                are still on their way to being adopted on any 
                                broad scale, getting started with Grid can seem 
                                daunting. This panel will include distinguished 
                                members of the Grid community who have been in 
                                your shoes and understand the struggle you face 
                                in proving the value of Grid. Panel discussion 
                                points include: 1) assessing where best to start 
                                and specifying key selection criteria for determining 
                                pilot opportunities; 2) choosing the most appropriate 
                                solutions and building blocks to meet your needs; 
                                3) measuring the impact in terms of improvement, 
                                ROI and value; 4) accessing key web and community 
                                resources at your disposal; 5) and, determining 
                                the follow-on steps that ultimately steer your 
                                organization toward a vision that best suits your 
                                requirements for business success and long-term 
                                survival.<br>

                              <p>The entertainment industry may well provide a 
                                model for how grids and P2P technologies will 
                                work together in the not so distant future. Compute 
                                grids (AKA, renderfarms) have long been at the 
                                core of the content creation process for companies 
                                like Dreamworks, Pixar, and Disney. It's possible 
                                grids and utility computing will eventually enable 
                                smaller production houses to compete with the 
                                big studios. What are the technical and business 
                                barriers to the adoption of standards-based grids 
                                that will enable content creators of all sizes 
                                to access a more responsive IT infrastructure? 
                                And will the 'other' cousin of grid, P2P, have 
                                a role in content distribution? Not yet, but service 
                                providers and content owners are warming up to 
                                the idea that broadcast quality video can be economically 
                                distributed over the Internet. <br>

                                resources, but to realize a broader vision of 
                                distributed, service-oriented architectures. With

                                is generally accepted as more of a long-term consideration

                              <p>Software licensing has become a key concern for 
                                users as grid computing gains momentum in enterprise 
                                IT. The bottom line is that per-CPU licensing 
                                doesn&#8217;t work on grids and conventional models 
                                may throttle progress. Alternative purchase models 
                                (subscription, pay-as-you-go, outsourcing) as 
                                well as new technologies (multicore, virtualization) 
                                suggest a change is under way that will have a 
                                cumulative and disruptive impact on vendor licensing 
                                policies and practices. Software licensing for 
                                grids must therefore be seen within the context 
                                of other dynamics. However it is the ability to 
                                proactively manage the use of software licenses 
                                based on business objectives which grid users 
                                are seeking. This panel will explore what grid 
                                users need from their software suppliers and how 
                                they are coping today. Will vendors step up with 
                                more flexible approaches? <br>

                              <p>IT is seen as an asset industry-wide but is in 
                                many ways a victim of its own success. With more 
                                and more businesses becoming dependent upon IT, 
                                technology has been more widely deployed to meet 
                                increasing demand. In the process current underlying 
                                technologies have frequently proven inflexible, 
                                expensive, and unreliable. Consequently, the capacity 
                                for IT to provide innovation and bottom-line benefit 
                                has stagnated. An innovative solution is desperately 
                                required to address these problems. This solution 
                                is Service Oriented Computing. <br>
                                <br>
                                Service Oriented Computing requires a Service 
                                Oriented Infrastructure and Service Oriented Architecture, 
                                leveraging Grid principles and technology. Standards 
                                and interoperability play an ever-increasing role 
                                in this next era of computing, which requires 
                                running IT as a service provider in order to accelerate 
                                differentiation. Automating IT will become the 
                                source of differentiation. IT must focus on the 
                                economics of IT service delivery every bit as 
                                much as it does on the technology and delivery 
                                of IT. <br>

                                Trends of network-based computing coupled with 
                                the challenge of operational complexity have resulted 
                                in increased IT cost pressures. The long-term 
                                impact of ongoing cost pressures on innovation 
                                can be directly correlated to the ability of IT 
                                to enable and accelerate the business. The economics 
                                of agility will support new business opportunities 
                                and help IT fund and manage change as a competitive 
                                weapon. Service Oriented Computing will also bring 
                                a new future to business transparency, SLA's, 
                                cost allocation and asset management, thereby 
                                enabling the business to more equitably pay for 
                                the technologies enabling its future. A new means 
                                of managing technology resources against the business 
                                demand will be the Virtual Resource Market (VRM). 
                                The VRM is an economic marketplace enabling resources 
                                to be allocated efficiently to meet the changing 
                                business demand.<br>

                                The benefits of this technology revolution will 
                                position IT to differentiate the business. Through 
                                virtualization, automation and the use of commodity 
                                components, IT will deliver increased availability, 
                                utilization, agility and manageability while decreasing 
                                its cost and footprint.<br>

                              <p>Grids are making it possible for the world&#8217;s 
                                engineering community to expand beyond national 
                                borders. This globalization trend is affecting 
                                the aerospace, automotive and electronics industries. 
                                Grid computing has become an important tool in 
                                this new environment, where the paradigm for engineering 
                                design processes is changing. Why Grids? Dramatic 
                                improvements in product quality, performance, 
                                and time-to-market can be achieved by deploying 
                                Grids, but are not possible through limited enhancements 
                                to computer systems. They also cannot be met by 
                                solving a single large-scale problem by applying 
                                parallel processing. Computational power must 
                                be ubiquitous to achieve enhanced performance, 
                                quality, and time-to-market.</p>
                              <p>Grid computing makes almost infinite computational 
                                power available for engineering design when companies 
                                are linked through broadband networks. This keynote 
                                describes the statistical methods and simulations 
                                that firms in Japan and around the world are using 
                                with grid computing. It explores the global collaboration 
                                that Grid computing makes possible in engineering 
                                design. The presentation also illustrates how 
                                Grids permit companies to streamline their design 
                                processes as a result of inter-company and inter-national

                                Once you have been able to prove the benefit and 
                                value of Grid on a small or local scale, the next 
                                major step that you are likely to face is broad-scale 
                                adoption potentially across your entire organization.

                                investment has been for eScience initiatives,

                              <p>Businesses today are adopting grid computing 
                                to harness the processing power of existing computers 
                                to analyze complex, data intensive applications. 
                                As data volumes continue to grow and IT spending 
                                is limited, grid computing is a strategic alternative 
                                to resolve this dilemma. In order to gain a competitive 
                                advantage, companies must be innovative and discover 
                                ways to improve cost savings, increase business

                                The industry has envisioned a new world of distributed 
                                computing where application services execute on 
                                shared resources that are dynamically allocated 
                                and managed in an automated, efficient and utility-like 
                                manner. The journey to this new world involves 
                                the transformation from vertically integrated 
                                silos to horizontally integrated infrastructure<br>
                                and applications that delivery IT as a service. 
                                Terms such as grid, virtualization, service-orientation 
                                and utility seek describe important aspects of 
                                this new world. However, like the well-known fable 
                                of the blind men and the elephant, it is difficult 
                                to understand the reality behind the words and 
                                how the various terms fit together. This panel 
                                will explore how these popular terms relate to 
                                each other and how when combined with industry 
                                standards begin to realize the transformation 
                                to this new world of distributed computing.<br>

                              explore, adopt, deploy. One of the last challenges 
                              of Grid deployment is getting the applications on 
                              the Grid. No organization deploys a grid for the 
                              sake of having a grid. With financial and time-sensitive 
                              pressures increasing, companies in all industries 
                              need more immediate and more accurate answers to 
                              the most critical business decisions. Companies 
                              turn to the power of grid computing to make these 
                              decisions faster and more accurately. These sensitive 
                              decisions are dependent on complex applications. 
                              Fully deployed, Grids should be transparent, invisible 
                              to the user, with the applications front and centre. 
                              That is why we end Grid World with an expert panel

                              <p>The problem: most applications contain intricate 
                                algorithms that are not designed for migration 
                                to distributed environments. Companies can feel 
                                that they are left with one of two alternatives: 
                                spending thousands of dollars on re-writing the 
                                applications or rejecting grid computing as a 
                                solution.</p>
                              <p>Our panelists will discuss how a new application-centric 
                                approach to grid or distributed computing overcomes 
                                application challenges on the Grid. They will 
                                focus on the approach, their experiences, and 
                                results.</p>
                              <p>They will offer recommendations on how companies 
                                can efficiently migrate to a distributed environment 
                                - optimizing response times, increasing scalability, 
                                obtaining real-time analysis &#8211; all while 
                                saving time and costs. Altering any of the underlying 
                                logic and algorithms of an application(s); suffering 
                                through lengthy conversion times; and changing

<PRE>A few comments inline, just in case I can't make the call.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Yes, I think it should be optional in the schema and made mandatory  in
the HPCP (for the 'final' submission to the container).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Donal changed the Argument type from normalizedstring to string. If I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  recall correctly there was a very long and heated discussion around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this in the past (but, happily perhaps, I can't recall details). Could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone who was involved in the definition of this element followup?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The difference is that xsd:normalizedString trims spaces and xsd:string
</I>&gt;<i> does not. For arguments, it is sometimes necessary to have leading or
</I>&gt;<i> trailing spaces. Occasionally, you even need args that are nothing but
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace. What this spec is supposed to do is to indicate that
</I>&gt;<i> whatever the implementation does, it must get the argument quoting right
</I>&gt;<i> so that (near[*]) arbitrary arguments can be given.
</I>
I still can't remember the discussions on this but I believe this was
the reason we allowed empty argument elements and said they must not be
collapsed. The question I have if you change the argument type to a
string is then why do you need multiple argument elements?

Also I don't have a big problem with restricting definitions (e.g., by
removing the filesystem attribute in this application extension) but I
do have a problem with changing types for identically named elements.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Working directory - In contrast to Donal's comment I think if this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not present it should not be created.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the user doesn't give a working directory, it's up to the implementor
</I>&gt;<i> to do some default way of handling this. Some systems will want to do
</I>&gt;<i> this by running in the home directory, and others will want to create a
</I>&gt;<i> new per-job directory. The only files that the user should count on
</I>&gt;<i> being there are those that they have staged there themselves. (If the
</I>&gt;<i> user does not specify any stagings, they must obviously not be relying
</I>&gt;<i> on any relatively-named files at all. Their choice.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever the implementor does, they should document what they do in that
</I>&gt;<i> case. The HPC Profile may wish to restrict this. (I'd recommend that
</I>&gt;<i> they do just that!)
</I>
Donal, are you saying that if the directory is not present it should be
up to the implementation to decide what to do? I read your comment as
saying that the specification should state that the directory should be
created.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Btw, I am really curious here, how is a user going to specify that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want a job to run in their home directory, wherever that place may be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Surely the exact location may differ from machine to machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This spec (and more particularly the HPC Profile) isn't about defining
</I>&gt;<i> portable jobs anyway. After all, requiring an executable pathname isn't
</I>&gt;<i> even close to portable, and nor is there any mechanism for dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> differences in path separator between platforms. (At least nobody is
</I>&gt;<i> trying to suggest that MacOS 9 should be used as a HPC platform; the
</I>&gt;<i> directory separator scheme there was *much* different...)
</I>
Yes, but it is still a common use case to run a job with 'home' being
the working directory, or in a subdirectory relative of home. I think a
way to specify that without giving the full path name isn't too much to ask.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Why was GroupName dropped?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not portable to non-POSIX platforms I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Donal.
</I>&gt;<i> [* You'd still be limited by the XML 1.0 spec, and there's the whole
</I>&gt;<i>    separate business of understanding the character encodings actually
</I>&gt;<i>    used. Perhaps the spec should say something there, since it is likely
</I>&gt;<i>    that just copying the bytes from the input document won't work. ]

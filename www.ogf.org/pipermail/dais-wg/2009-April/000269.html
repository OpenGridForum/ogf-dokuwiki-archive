DAIS Interop Telcon - 31 March 2009
===================================

Present:
 	Mario Antonioletti, EPCC
 	Mike Jackson, EPCC
 	Steve Lynden, AIST
 	Sunil Ahn, Kisti
         Giacinto Donvito, INFN
         Isao Kojima, AIST

Agenda:

    - Agenda bashing
    - Introductions
    - Process
      - Agree on:
            * port type binding to SOAP 1.1
            * binding document/literal or rpc/literal
            * canonical version of the wsdl/xsd
      - Come up with a scenario and database to use
      - Putting up end points to test
      - Coming up with a test suite
      - Roles
      - Time lines

----

Actions
-------

[MAA] speak to the ByteIO folks to determine whether they had a
       rationale for using document/literal and establish whether there
       is a preference in OGF in general.

[MJJ] check whether changing the OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR implementation to use
       document/literal would entail a lot of work.

[SA] Document the changes required to change the WSDL to work with
      gsoap for rpc/literal.

[MAA] Publish the DAIS WSDL and XSD on GridForge.

[SA] Put up some information on the scenario/test suite used by AMGA
      to do their testing.

[MJJ] Put a version of the DAIX test-suite on the DAIS Grid Forge.

Agenda bashing
--------------

No new items were added for discussion.

Introductions
-------------

A brief introduction by each of the participants was given:

Mario Antonioletti is one of the the working group chair for the DAIS
working group and is part of the OGSA-DAI team.

Mike Jackson is one of the main developers in OGSA-DAI and developed
the OGSA-DAI WS-DAIX implementation as well as being involved in the
design of the WS-DAIR implementation.

Steven Lynden used to be involved in DAIS a while back and was one of
the authors of the GFD77 which specified interop testing. He also
wrote a test suite for WS-DAIX but could not proceed to interop
testing as there were no implementations.

Sunil Ahn developed the AMGA WS-DAIR implementation.

Giacinto Donvito works for INFN and has an interest in accessing
databases, has done some scalability/performance testing for various
of the existing database access interfaces and hence has an interest
in the WS-DAIR effort.

Process
-------

MAA suggested that we should try to use the process outlined in GFD.77
- &quot;Interoperability Testing for DAIS Working Group Specifications&quot;.

Need to agree on:

* port type binding to SOAP 1.1

Sunil said they were using SOAP 1.1. It appears that the OGSA-DAI
WS-DAIR implementation is also using SOAP 1.1. Later Steven said
that their developer that used OGSA-DAI-RDF used SOAP 1.2.

Consensus seemed to be with SOAP 1.2.

* binding document/literal or rpc/literal

Currently the OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR implementation uses rpc/literal. Need
to determine how much effort would be required to use a
document/literal style.

Sunil said that AMGA used document/literal but he had tried to use
rpc/literal with gsoap and this had required changes to the WSDL
(about 20 lines) for this to go through.

The ByteIO folks used document/literal. Need to determine whether there
was a good reason for this and whether there are any OGF/OGSA
guidelines on this.

Steven commented that WS-I preferred the document/literal style.

Decision on this has been deferred until more information is
available.  A number of actions came out of this to provide
this information.

* canonical version of the wsdl/xsd

Mario is going to put up a version of the WSDL up on Grid Forge.

- Come up with a scenario and database to use

When Steven was involved in writing GFD.77 he did not have any
specific scenario in mind for the relational data.

OGSA-DAI used their littleblackbook test database with some store
procedures.

AMGA used an SQL test benchmark suite released by NIST.

Decision deferred on scenario and test data until more info goes up on
the wiki. It could be a combination of the two above possibilities.

In this instance we would be doing interoperability only and not
performance/scalability.

- Putting up end points to test

An OGSA-DAI WS-DAIR end-point could be put up at EPCC.
An AMGA WS-DAIR end-point could be put as well.

- Coming up with a test suite

Steven originally wrote a WS-DAIX test suite which has been
used by OGSA-DAI. A version of this will be put up on the wiki.

- Roles

Deferred.

- Time lines

Next telcon will be on Thursday 8am (GMT+1) April 16th.

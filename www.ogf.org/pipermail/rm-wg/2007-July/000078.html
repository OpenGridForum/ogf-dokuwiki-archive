Discussion
 
Laurence described the GLUE Schema 2 context, as per his email (<A HREF="http://forge.ogf.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.glue-wg/wiki/PhoneMeeting20070713RMWGLaurence">http://forge.ogf.org/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.glue-wg/wiki/PhoneMeeting20070713RMWGLaurence</A>) and requested feedback as to whether this was in line with the Ref Model and so forth.  He noted that it was the concepts rather than the names that were important.
 
The general concensus (Steve, Paul and Dave) was that the Ref Model is fairly high level and abstract, and focused on managability, leaving plenty of latitude for the GLUE group to specialize as needed.  The Ref Model in intended as a highly extensible, abstract umbrella model which allows references or mappings to other models.  Thus it provides a unified context for a number of complementary, yet incomplete (with regards to context) models, and a basis for specialization, such as GLUE.
 
The discussion then went into how to break down the GLUE problem domain - the appropriate entities and perhaps how they map to the Ref Model.  Indeed it became clear that an exercise in mapping this, and especially focusing on the notion of Shares (as per <A HREF="http://forge.ogf.org/sf/go/doc14639?nav=1">http://forge.ogf.org/sf/go/doc14639?nav=1</A>) would be a very useful exercise for the combined team to undertake.
 
Actions
RMWG members to carefully review GLUE 2 Schema - <A HREF="http://forge.ogf.org/sf/go/doc14639?nav=1">http://forge.ogf.org/sf/go/doc14639?nav=1</A>
Next meeting (20th July) will be an internal meeting to discuss GLUE 2 work.
Following meeting (27th July) will be another joint meeting between the GLUE WG and RMWG

<PRE>Hi Paul

Strong, Paul wrote:
&gt;<i> So, if I understand correctly, the management abstractions behind the
</I>&gt;<i> Service are only important in that...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)   The Job must have a way of expressing it's dependencies - that is
</I>&gt;<i> what binaries it may need, what data it may need, what types of CPU it
</I>&gt;<i> can run on etc.  JSDL can supply this - right?
</I>
yes, JSDL is the solution for this; in its evolution, a JSDL document 
will contain an XQuery expression for expressing the requirements on the 
resource (e.g., OSType); the resource is expected to be modeled by GLUE;

in other words, GLUE will provide the resource description on which 
users can express requirements for their jobs

&gt;<i> 2)   The Job must have a way of expressing the desired service level
</I>&gt;<i> objectives, for example desired completion time (absolute), maximum job
</I>&gt;<i> duration, maximum % of resources to be consumed and so forth.
</I>
yes

&gt;<i> 3)   The User must be able to get monitoring information and results
</I>&gt;<i> from the service that include progress versus service level, resources
</I>&gt;<i> consumed versus share and so forth.
</I>
yes, this is typically provided by the BES interface;

&gt;<i> This brings us back to what Dave was suggesting about drilling down on
</I>&gt;<i> Share (to some degree).   The area to be refined is perhaps more on the
</I>&gt;<i> side of the interaction of the user with the service and between the two
</I>&gt;<i> organizations.  For example when submitting the Job and querying
</I>&gt;<i> progress of the Job.  Examples -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)	Do Users simply know what services they can access based on a
</I>&gt;<i> set of Shares or agreements already in place between their organization
</I>&gt;<i> and the Admin Domain?   Do they poll services (that are presumably
</I>&gt;<i> advertized) to see which ones they have shares with and which have spare
</I>&gt;<i> capacity? 
</I>yes, this is the scenario in current production Grids like EGEE and the 
one that we want to support for GLUE 2

&gt;<i> Or can they dynamically negotiate access/Shares and so forth?
</I>
this is a more complex situation; BES does not support negotiation; 
there is a specific language for this (WS-Agreement), but this is not in 
our focus so far


&gt;<i> 2)	How complete or self contained does the job submission have to
</I>&gt;<i> be? Thus is it simply a request for a binary already installed and made
</I>&gt;<i> available by the service or can the submission include the binary and
</I>&gt;<i> instructions on how this should be deployed? :o)  
</I>
the second option; GLUE 1.3 includes attributes to support this 
scenario; you can see a raw summary of the potential attributes for each 
  class in the GLUE 2 draft that you already have (below each table 
there is a flat list coming from GLUE 1.3 and NorduGrid)

&gt;<i> This makes a big
</I>&gt;<i> difference in terms of the level of detail that needs to be exposed by
</I>&gt;<i> the Service and expressed in the Share concept.
</I>

I still have to digest your proposal. A couple of early comments:

1. I see the Share as a specialization of Policy; can you remind me what 
are management concepts that apply to a policy? and also, what do you 
think about moving from share concept to SLA?

2. can you give a draft definition of what a container is in this context?


Cheers, Sergio

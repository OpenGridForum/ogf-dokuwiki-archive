<PRE>Alan,

Comments and questions in-line.

I doubt you will find any broad interest in developing standards for this. It is certainly not a commonly used approach that people have a lot of experience with.  I fear going down this path will derail the proposed AuthN work.

&gt;<i> &gt; While there are certainly interesting AuthN topics to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss which go beyond the identified 'express' work, I am very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concerned about having two AuthN groups working in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The efforts are already essentially combined.  We pulled back on
</I>&gt;<i> pushing the OGSA-AuthN work forward in order to be able to complete
</I>&gt;<i> work on the current document series.  My sense is that this work is
</I>&gt;<i> now reaching a mature state and that the charter work can go forward
</I>&gt;<i> on defining the AuthN body of work.  The HPC-profile work done and
</I>&gt;<i> now going on can be regarded as the first set of output from this
</I>&gt;<i> combined effort.
</I>
I'm confused by your statement that they are &quot;essentially combined&quot;. Perhaps you and Andrew can clarify? The scope and technical approach for the 'express' profile work is still being discussed, so it doesn't seem to be in a mature state. The plan seems to be to continue the 'express' work in parallel with a separate OGSA AuthN charter discussion. I'm still concerned potential AuthN contributors will have trouble engaging with two independent efforts, to the detriment of both. The HPCP work can certainly be seen as a precursor, but is an independent effort which is not an OGSA specification.

Regards,
Blair Dillaway

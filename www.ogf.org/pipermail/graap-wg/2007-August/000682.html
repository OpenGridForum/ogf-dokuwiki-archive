</I>&gt;<i> Renegotiatinganestablished Agreement
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Toshi, I have the following comments/observations after reviewing your
</I>&gt;<i> wiki page... sorry I have not been able to keep a close watch on the
</I>&gt;<i> recent activities of the group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The idea of negotiation of alternatives is difficult and I think
</I>&gt;<i>    requires a better negotiation protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    After much debate, as I recall, we limited WS-Agreement to simple
</I>&gt;<i>    acceptance of an offer.  If the offer has alternatives in it, then
</I>&gt;<i>    the responder is accepting to satisfy this compound expression in
</I>&gt;<i>    any way he sees fit, with no information about how, or indeed
</I>&gt;<i>    whether his solution might vary over time and be satisfied by
</I>&gt;<i>    different clauses in the compound rules!  It would take
</I>&gt;<i>    domain-specific interpretation of the SDTs to somehow fix this
</I>&gt;<i>    solution, as there is nothing in the protocol to communicate a
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;lowering&quot; or simplification of the alternatives expression.  (For
</I>&gt;<i>    example, I anticipated that in a basic use of JSDL for a job term,
</I>&gt;<i>    the interpretation could be defined that the service terms are
</I>&gt;<i>    chosen at job-start time and frozen, as is a typical implementation
</I>&gt;<i>    requirement for HPC resources... you would know they are not
</I>&gt;<i>    time-varying, though there is still no facility to communicate
</I>&gt;<i>    which exact parameters were chosen.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What I would suggest is that you try to keep this aspect of
</I>&gt;<i>    negotiation protocol orthogonal to the underlying notion of
</I>&gt;<i>    renegotiation.  First, work on the semantics for renegotiation of
</I>&gt;<i>    an agreement as you have done, e.g. replacement/superceding of an
</I>&gt;<i>    agreement.  Then, admit that basic or advanced protocols could be
</I>&gt;<i>    used to negotiate either the initial or subsequent agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    For example, a relatively simple renegotiation could adapt the
</I>&gt;<i>    existing factory pattern for both initial and subsequent
</I>&gt;<i>    negotiations.  If a future specification provides a multi-round
</I>&gt;<i>    negotiation to lower/simplify abstract agreement constraints to a
</I>&gt;<i>    more concrete solution, this could replace the basic factory
</I>&gt;<i>    pattern in both cases too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I think the idea of superceding an agreement is fine, but I have
</I>&gt;<i>    trouble seeing a distinction between this and the general use of
</I>&gt;<i>    agreements in the context of other agreements.  For example, the
</I>&gt;<i>    advance reservation scenario allows &quot;claiming&quot; of a resource
</I>&gt;<i>    reservation, and you can interpret this as adjusting an initial
</I>&gt;<i>    resource agreement to include binding to an application, with the
</I>&gt;<i>    same results as if someone simply negotiated an application with
</I>&gt;<i>    the same QoS terms in one shot...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What I would point out is that this claiming/context model allows
</I>&gt;<i>    many:many derivation of agreements in the general case.  E.g. I
</I>&gt;<i>    could reserve a large resource (in space-time) and consume it with
</I>&gt;<i>    multiple applications which either run serially or in parallel.  I
</I>&gt;<i>    could also combine several resources (in separate agreements) into
</I>&gt;<i>    a complex application.  Couldn't a renegotiation also be temporary,
</I>&gt;<i>    e.g. &quot;boost this resource reservation for the next hour, but then
</I>&gt;<i>    fall back to the previous terms&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I am not sure how &quot;supercededby&quot; would be applicable here.  Is it
</I>&gt;<i>    worth having one more general metalanguage for discovery/navigation
</I>&gt;<i>    of agreements which are linked to other agreements?  We could use
</I>&gt;<i>    the extensibility of the wsag:Context to enumerate the actual
</I>&gt;<i>    claimed or superseded agreements, and it seems useful to have a
</I>&gt;<i>    dynamic resource property which could provide reverse-lookup of new
</I>&gt;<i>    agreements which list an agreement in the new wsag:Context too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Also, a general concern I have is that the discussions are not
</I>&gt;<i>    crisp about the uses of the agreement.  The talk of race conditions
</I>&gt;<i>    makes me nervous, as it seems to combine denotation of service
</I>&gt;<i>    terms with the implementation of resource managers.  In my view,
</I>&gt;<i>    WS-Agreement is completely focused on the establishment of terms
</I>&gt;<i>    between the two parties, and says nothing about how one of the
</I>&gt;<i>    parties is implementing the protocol.  I do not see a necessary
</I>&gt;<i>    race condition for &quot;supercededby&quot; because I don't think the
</I>&gt;<i>    initiator (for example) needs to be aware of this state change in
</I>&gt;<i>    order to meaningfully express a claim against an agreement.  If an
</I>&gt;<i>    agreement is renegotiated, it could still be usable for claiming by
</I>&gt;<i>    name, while the actual resource manager has to take into account
</I>&gt;<i>    that there are now aliases to the newly revised delivery terms...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The question of having &quot;responder initiated renegotiation&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i>    foreseen in the optional symmetric protocol mode. In essence, if
</I>&gt;<i>    EPRs are exchanged so that both parties have an EPR representing
</I>&gt;<i>    the other party's view of the agreement, then they can switch roles
</I>&gt;<i>    and become initiator for further rounds of communication.  In order
</I>&gt;<i>    to use this feature, one would need to define an extension to the
</I>&gt;<i>    protocol, e.g. have the symmetric agreement resources support an
</I>&gt;<i>    extended protocol which includes the renegotiation operations as
</I>&gt;<i>    well as the basic monitoring/cancellation operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I think it would be appropriate to define a new negotiation
</I>&gt;<i>    protocol as a profile on this feature, so that a specific SDT would
</I>&gt;<i>    demand the presence of a renegotiation facility which would then be
</I>&gt;<i>    available as extended operations and resource properties on the
</I>&gt;<i>    Agreement resource.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Again, if we consider the fuzzy case of many:many renegotiations,
</I>&gt;<i>    the best approach might be a simple RP in the agreement that holds
</I>&gt;<i>    an EPR to the renegotiation service, thereby separating discovery
</I>&gt;<i>    (via lookup of this RP an existing agreement) from claiming/context
</I>&gt;<i>    references which might involve more than one agreement at a time.

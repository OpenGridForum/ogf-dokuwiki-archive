&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Toshi, I have the following comments/observations after reviewing your
</I>&gt;<i> wiki page... sorry I have not been able to keep a close watch on the
</I>&gt;<i> recent activities of the group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The idea of negotiation of alternatives is difficult and I think
</I>&gt;<i>    requires a better negotiation protocol.
</I>
OK

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What I would suggest is that you try to keep this aspect of
</I>&gt;<i>    negotiation protocol orthogonal to the underlying notion of
</I>&gt;<i>    renegotiation.  First, work on the semantics for renegotiation of
</I>&gt;<i>    an agreement as you have done, e.g. replacement/superceding of an
</I>&gt;<i>    agreement.  Then, admit that basic or advanced protocols could be
</I>&gt;<i>    used to negotiate either the initial or subsequent agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I think this is fine as *much* discussion would have to be made for
negotiation of alternatives.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I think the idea of superceding an agreement is fine, but I have
</I>&gt;<i>    trouble seeing a distinction between this and the general use of
</I>&gt;<i>    agreements in the context of other agreements.  For example, the
</I>&gt;<i>    advance reservation scenario allows &quot;claiming&quot; of a resource
</I>&gt;<i>    reservation, and you can interpret this as adjusting an initial
</I>&gt;<i>    resource agreement to include binding to an application, with the
</I>&gt;<i>    same results as if someone simply negotiated an application with
</I>&gt;<i>    the same QoS terms in one shot...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What I would point out is that this claiming/context model allows
</I>&gt;<i>    many:many derivation of agreements in the general case.  E.g. I
</I>&gt;<i>    could reserve a large resource (in space-time) and consume it with
</I>&gt;<i>    multiple applications which either run serially or in parallel.  I
</I>&gt;<i>    could also combine several resources (in separate agreements) into
</I>&gt;<i>    a complex application.  Couldn't a renegotiation also be temporary,
</I>&gt;<i>    e.g. &quot;boost this resource reservation for the next hour, but then
</I>&gt;<i>    fall back to the previous terms&quot;?
</I>
Your points are exactly what we had in mind in the business grid project..
(The scenarios are included in HPCC2006 paper
<A HREF="http://www.coregrid.net/mambo/images/stories/TechnicalReports/tr-0050.pdf">http://www.coregrid.net/mambo/images/stories/TechnicalReports/tr-0050.pdf</A> 
I've also uploaded an excerpt from the presentation we made onto the Wiki.
The last slide exactly shows the point  I wanted to make.)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I am not sure how &quot;supercededby&quot; would be applicable here. 
</I>
I think Supercededby could be useful for some purposes.
eg. Logging purposes to show which Agreement had been effective until when
then
Superceded/replaced by which Agreement to check for SLA violation etc.

&gt;<i>    Is it
</I>&gt;<i>    worth having one more general metalanguage for discovery/navigation
</I>&gt;<i>    of agreements which are linked to other agreements?  We could use
</I>&gt;<i>    the extensibility of the wsag:Context to enumerate the actual
</I>&gt;<i>    claimed or superseded agreements, 
</I>
 I think this could be one way of realizing this feature.
 (I had intended to put the 'Superceded-by &quot; in the wsag:Context)

&gt;<i> and it seems useful to have a
</I>&gt;<i>    dynamic resource property which could provide reverse-lookup of new
</I>&gt;<i>    agreements which list an agreement in the new wsag:Context too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Also, a general concern I have is that the discussions are not
</I>&gt;<i>    crisp about the uses of the agreement.  The talk of race conditions
</I>&gt;<i>    makes me nervous, as it seems to combine denotation of service
</I>&gt;<i>    terms with the implementation of resource managers.  In my view,
</I>&gt;<i>    WS-Agreement is completely focused on the establishment of terms
</I>&gt;<i>    between the two parties, and says nothing about how one of the
</I>&gt;<i>    parties is implementing the protocol. 
</I>
I agree that this is a bit of an implementation issue but
I think the discussion we had in Terminating was that Termination could take
a long time to
be decided and we extended the Agreement State wiht such states as
ObservedAndTerminating
so I had wanted to be consistent in this sense.

##As an off track issue,  It seems in creating the official pdf, 
# <A HREF="http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.107.pdf">http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.107.pdf</A>

Figure in Section 7.1 got corrupted..  Any way to remedy this?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The question of having &quot;responder initiated renegotiation&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i>    foreseen in the optional symmetric protocol mode. In essence, if
</I>&gt;<i>    EPRs are exchanged so that both parties have an EPR representing
</I>&gt;<i>    the other party's view of the agreement, then they can switch roles
</I>&gt;<i>    and become initiator for further rounds of communication.  In order
</I>&gt;<i>    to use this feature, one would need to define an extension to the
</I>&gt;<i>    protocol, e.g. have the symmetric agreement resources support an
</I>&gt;<i>    extended protocol which includes the renegotiation operations as
</I>&gt;<i>    well as the basic monitoring/cancellation operations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I think it would be appropriate to define a new negotiation
</I>&gt;<i>    protocol as a profile on this feature, so that a specific SDT would
</I>&gt;<i>    demand the presence of a renegotiation facility which would then be
</I>&gt;<i>    available as extended operations and resource properties on the
</I>&gt;<i>    Agreement resource.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Again, if we consider the fuzzy case of many:many renegotiations,
</I>&gt;<i>    the best approach might be a simple RP in the agreement that holds
</I>&gt;<i>    an EPR to the renegotiation service, thereby separating discovery
</I>&gt;<i>    (via lookup of this RP an existing agreement) from claiming/context
</I>&gt;<i>    references which might involve more than one agreement at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This is an interesting (if stagering) point.
I had naively assumed that AR would be maintaining the Agreements
A third party Agreement Factory could solve the problem with No.7 but
this might have quite an impact on other parts of WS-Agreement Spec.

Comments from other people also appreciated.

Best Regards and Thanks
Toshi

feedback from OGF 20.  More use cases have been added.

Action: LF to create the draft document which should be ready by the 
26th of June, in time for the next OGSA meeting.

LF: Will do.

LF: The reference model group needs to help us with the main entities 
(Site, Service, Resource) and the relationships between them.

Action:  ES will bring this up in the next reference model phone call.

BZ: The reference model group should take a look at the main entities 
that we have defined.

SA: Not much work has been done on the CE schema since OGF20. Only 
general capability and APAC use cases.

LF: Need to wait for the draft use case document before moving forward

LF: We needs to start moving forward on the SE schema

??: What groups do we need to consider other than the SRM group

Action: LF to poll information from Glue, JSDL and OGSA email lists.

Action: Need to find someone to coordinate the SE schema definition work.

Action: People should send suggestions of who could to this to LF.

Schema work.  I will sent around the presentation for comments and 
suggestions.

<PRE>Hi Gerson,

The schema is in an early draft state and therefore might still need a 
little work to get it into good shape. If you have any suggestions on 
how to improve the schema or can see any problems please let us know. I 
will try an answer you question based on what I understand of the 
current draft.

What is important is to first understand the entities that we are 
dealing with and the relationships between them.

For me a cluster represents a set of resources that are managed, which 
essentially is a batch system with a master server. The queue represents 
two things; an end point and a policy.  The GRAM service is an interface 
to the batch system and therefore an end point.

How you represent these things depends on the implementation.

1) If the job attributes are passed to the batch system, then based on 
these it should decide which queue (policy) best matches the 
requirements. In such a scenario,
you would then publish two services (end points), one for each batch 
system, and the gateway should route the job to the relevant batch 
system based on which service (end point) was used.

2) If the the job requirements are not passed though, then you have to 
consider each queue to be a different endpoint and hence have a service 
(end point) per batch system and per queue (policy). The gateway would 
then route the job also to the correct queue.

In either case the policy (queue) would be advertised as a share. 
However, in the second case I am not sure how the end point is linked to 
the policy.

</I>&gt;<i> You have a comment in the form of a question under the &quot;element&quot;

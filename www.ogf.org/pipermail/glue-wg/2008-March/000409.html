<PRE>Hi Felix,

today I won't be able to connect due to phone/network unavailability 
here at CNAF because of  our data center renovation. 

Tomorrow, I plan to stay at home so I can call/connect.

Anyway, I'm sending you a number of thoughts on the current storage 
entities model:

- &quot;Shared&quot; Storage Share

the solution of relating a storage capacity to a storage mapping policy 
to  advertise  used space per  policy seems to over-complicate the 
model; the storage capacity concept is being adopted by different 
entities with slightly different meaning and this leads to a not very 
intuitive and usable model;

our proposal is to act as follows:

* For Storage Share
1- add a shared attribute in the storage share which type is boolean; 
for &quot;shared&quot; shares, the value should be true
2- add an AggregationLocalID attribute; for the &quot;shared&quot; shares within 
the same storage service, this attribute should be assigned with the 
same value

in this way, we avoid the creation of one more level of hierarchy and 
potential visualization tools which want to show a summary info can 
avoid double counting by checking the two attributes that we propose

* For Storage Environment:
when we mapped the current model to our T1 use case, we found out that 
the storage environment is homogeneous; therefore there is not need (at 
least for our scenario) to have the capacity to be associated to the 
storage environment; the attributes of the storage capacity can be added 
to the storage environment

* For Storage Resource:
since information about free/used/total/reserved space is provided by 
the storage environment, we could avoid to have summary info at the 
storage resource level; information consumer can aggregate it

If the above considerations fit the use cases of other partners, then 
the storage capacity would be related only to the storage share.

As regards the today agenda, I removed the following issues since they 
do not properly reflect our scenario .

** consequence of overlapping StorageResource entities
*** GPFS 3.1 and GPFS 3.2 share same disks
*** if wished to be expressed explicitly -&gt; each GPFS is represented as 
own StorageResource
*** BUT then : a higher aggregation of capacity numbers muster be given 
in the service (again: if wished)
*** OR (easier): express GPFS 3.1 and 3.2 in OtherInfo field

in our mapping choice, we have decided to model the three storage 
systems managed by GPFS 3.1, GPFS 3.2 and TSM respectively using the 
storage environment concept. They do not logically overlap. (See here 
<A HREF="http://glueman.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/glueman/tags/glue-xsd/draft-29/examples/AdminDomain_CNAF.xml?revision=27">http://glueman.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/glueman/tags/glue-xsd/draft-29/examples/AdminDomain_CNAF.xml?revision=27</A>)
In our scenario, we have one global storage resource composed by three 
storage environments.

As a final comment, my opinion is that we should privilege simplicity 
and the meta-scheduling use cases more than the monitoring ones. If we 
do not manage to converge shortly on a common vision for the storage 
resource/storage environment, we should probably postpone the definition 
of these entities to a future GLUE  revision and concentrate on the 
storage endpoint/storage share consolidation.

Cheers, Sergio

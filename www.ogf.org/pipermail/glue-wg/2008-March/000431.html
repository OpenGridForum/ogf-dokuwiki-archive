<PRE>Hi Maarten,

Thanks for the comments; my comments are interleaved below.

I'm updated the document, but do people feel this is useful?

We could:
	folded the information into the GLUE 2.0 spec,
	keep it as an informative (non-normative) document,
	drop it, as being too confusing?

OK, I've added a paragraph on that.

&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; StorageEnvironment:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  A StorageEnvironment is a collection of one or more StorageCapacities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  with a set of associated (enforced) storage management policies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Examples of these policies are Type (Volatile, Durable, Permanent)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  and RetentionPolicy (Custodial, Output, Replica).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that we should get rid of the obsolete, confusing Type and Lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> attributes in favor of the ExpirationMode copied from SRM v3.
</I>
Should we do this with GLUE v2.0?

(I would be happy with that).


&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  A StorageResource is an aggregation of one or more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  StorageEnvironments and describes the hardware that a particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  software instance has under its control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See my reply to Sergio: we may rather want to allow an Environment
</I>&gt;<i> to be linked to multiple Resources, e.g. a disk and a tape Resource,
</I>&gt;<i> such that we can publish the back-end implementation name and version
</I>&gt;<i> for each of them.
</I>
Yes, I agree the bit about Environment being hosted in a single Resource is 
wrong; for example, dCache (a StorageResource) and TSM (a StorageResource) 
together host &quot;D1T1&quot;  (a StorageEnvironment), which has a disk-based 
StorageCapacity and a tape-base StorageCapacity.

I'm try to reword that bit.

[...]
&gt;<i> &gt; StorageShare:
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> &gt;  StorageSpaces must have one or more associated StorageCapacities.
</I>&gt;<i> |         ^^^^^^
</I>&gt;<i> |         Shares
</I>
Yes, I'm not sure what happened there: too many words beginning with &quot;S&quot;, I 
guess.

[...]
&gt;<i> &gt;  (SC_E) that is associated with some StorageEnvironment and which has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  totalSize TS_E, let the sum of the totalSize attributes for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> |                  ^^^
</I>&gt;<i> |                  let TS_S be .....
</I>
Err,  I think that one should be TS_E.  totalSize of the StorageShare 
associated with the Environment (the one &quot;underneath&quot; the 
StorageEnvironment).  In this context the StorageShare represents all of the 
physical medium.

Somehow, accurately describing what overlapping and incomplete StorageShares 
means takes a lot of words!


[...]
&gt;<i> &gt;  do not change as a result of file creation or deletion.  [Does GLUE need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to stipulate this, or should we leave this vague?]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why mention it at all?  You do not make statements about the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> of the other sizes, and I think there is no need to go there...
</I>
Well, we could just not mention it; however, I'm a little concerned about 
tacit assumptions, and how not everyone has the same set.  I'd hope we can 
make all the assumptions explicit.

In this particular case, there's (at least) a couple of models for how a space 
could work:

  a. partitioning: I'm allocating 10 TiB, I can store files up to that size of 
data (*).  Once I've written 10 TiB of data, I can delete files to create 
more space.  This is like having a 10 TiB hard disk to store data.

	(*) real-life systems have some complications, but considering an
		idealised storage system.

  b. consumable: I'm allocated 10 TiB storage.  I can store files up to that 
size of data.  I can delete the files if I like, but deleting files doesn't 
allow me to store more files.  Once I've used up that 10 TiB of storage, I 
have to ask for more.

(perhaps option b. seems a little crazy, but it might be how StorageShares 
would work with archival WORM media).

It seems that everyone in HEP assumes a partitioning model but I don't think 
I've seen it stated anywhere.  Other communities might assume a different 
model.  If we want information to be sharable (or mergable) I think we should 
state clearly any assumptions we're making.  If we don't assume anything, 
that should be noted too, so people consuming information know that either:
	1. they can't assume what happens, or
	2. if they assume something, that it's a WLCG convention that they must 
revisit when combining data with other information sources.


[...]
&gt;<i> &gt;  On observing a StorageAccessProcol, one may deduce only that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  it is valid for at least one user of one supported UserDomain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ..... from at least one computer.
</I>
True :)  I've added that, too.

Cheers,

Paul.

&gt;<i> Ciao Sergio,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * For Storage Share
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1- add a shared attribute in the storage share which type is boolean; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for &quot;shared&quot; shares, the value should be true
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2- add an AggregationLocalID attribute; for the &quot;shared&quot; shares within 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same storage service, this attribute should be assigned with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in this way, we avoid the creation of one more level of hierarchy and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; potential visualization tools which want to show a summary info can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avoid double counting by checking the two attributes that we propose
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, you would publish such a shared Share multiple times, once per VO.
</I>&gt;<i> Each such instance then gives a VO view of that Share.  I do not see a
</I>&gt;<i> problem for the info provider to cook up the correct values for the
</I>&gt;<i> boolean flag and the AggregationLocalID, but I do note that compared
</I>&gt;<i> to the proposal by Felix we lose some functionality: if each of the
</I>&gt;<i> VOs has a _quota_ in the Share, we would publish that number as, say,
</I>&gt;<i> its online TotalSize --&gt; this means we no longer have the _physical_
</I>&gt;<i> TotalSize of the Share published anywhere.  Maybe not a big loss...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would like to remind that NorduGrid has declared this accounting per 
tape/disk as a use case. 
For WLCG both solutions are fine since they have one Share/UserDomain.
I personally don't see any design problems and think that this is more 
than 'nice-to-have'.
However, if there are problems implementing/using such mechanism which 
_overload_ the advantages then we should drop it.



&gt;<i> &gt; * For Storage Resource:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since information about free/used/total/reserved space is provided by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the storage environment, we could avoid to have summary info at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; storage resource level; information consumer can aggregate it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The assumption then is that Environments will not overlap: probably OK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The Capacity-&gt;Resource link has been removed (v.32) and there will a note 
in the description of the Environment about the fact of non-overlapping.



&gt;<i> I would quite prefer having a Share always linked to a _single_
</I>&gt;<i> Environment, which itself will have an online component and may also
</I>&gt;<i> have a nearline component.
</I>We will discuss this on the next storage discussion (Thursday,03.04). From 
the main entities point of view we don't have any restrictions. 
One reason I remember for this current relation was to be aligned with the 
computing model (share-executionenviroment).   



&gt;<i> If we want to have separate implementation names and versions for
</I>&gt;<i> those components, it would seem natural to introduce the split at
</I>&gt;<i> the Resource level instead: an Environment can be linked to an online
</I>&gt;<i> Resource (e.g. with GPFS 3.2) and a nearline Resource (TSM X.Y.Z).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whichever way, we would like to publish such back-end implementation
</I>&gt;<i> names and versions explicitly.  Flavia has a use case: the name and
</I>&gt;<i> version of the back-end storage system should be available, such that
</I>&gt;<i> it can be deduced from the information system which sites are likely
</I>&gt;<i> to suffer from which open issues.  This is important information for
</I>&gt;<i> debugging operational problems in WLCG (and other grids).
</I>
I agree. But this can also happen in a OtherInfo field. And I tend to this 
rather making entities too complicated.
Sergio, should I postpone this issue until you're back with us 
(9.04.2008) ?




Cheerio,
	Felix

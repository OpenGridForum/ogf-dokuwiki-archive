<PRE>Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> I'm updated the document, but do people feel this is useful?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We could:
</I>&gt;<i> 	folded the information into the GLUE 2.0 spec,
</I>
That would be ideal.  Note that it will need to be adapted if we
cannot reach agreement on some statement it currently makes.

&gt;<i> 	keep it as an informative (non-normative) document,
</I>&gt;<i> 	drop it, as being too confusing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  A StorageEnvironment is a collection of one or more StorageCapacities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  with a set of associated (enforced) storage management policies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Examples of these policies are Type (Volatile, Durable, Permanent)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  and RetentionPolicy (Custodial, Output, Replica).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that we should get rid of the obsolete, confusing Type and Lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attributes in favor of the ExpirationMode copied from SRM v3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should we do this with GLUE v2.0?
</I>
Yes!  The ExpirationMode was invented to clear up the confusion that
has arisen from the (mis)use of Type/Lifetime for other purposes.

&gt;<i> (I would be happy with that).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  (SC_E) that is associated with some StorageEnvironment and which has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  totalSize TS_E, let the sum of the totalSize attributes for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; |                  ^^^
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; |                  let TS_S be .....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Err,  I think that one should be TS_E.  totalSize of the StorageShare 
</I>&gt;<i> associated with the Environment (the one &quot;underneath&quot; the 
</I>&gt;<i> StorageEnvironment).  In this context the StorageShare represents all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> physical medium.
</I>
Well, you wrote this before:

|<i>     let the sum of the totalSize attributes for all
</I>|<i>     StorageCapacities that are:
</I>|<i>           1. associated with a StorageSpace, and
</I>|<i>           2. that are implicitly associated with SC_E
</I>|<i>     be TS_S.
</I>
I suggested this instead:

|<i>     let TS_S be the sum of the totalSize attributes for all
</I>|<i>     StorageCapacities that are:
</I>|<i>           1. associated with a StorageShare, and
</I>|<i>           2. that are implicitly associated with SC_E
</I>|<i>     .
</I>
Spot the 3 differences!  It reads more easily...

&gt;<i> Somehow, accurately describing what overlapping and incomplete StorageShares 
</I>&gt;<i> means takes a lot of words!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  do not change as a result of file creation or deletion.  [Does GLUE need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to stipulate this, or should we leave this vague?]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why mention it at all?  You do not make statements about the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the other sizes, and I think there is no need to go there...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we could just not mention it; however, I'm a little concerned about 
</I>&gt;<i> tacit assumptions, and how not everyone has the same set.  I'd hope we can 
</I>&gt;<i> make all the assumptions explicit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this particular case, there's (at least) a couple of models for how a space 
</I>&gt;<i> could work:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   a. partitioning: I'm allocating 10 TiB, I can store files up to that size of 
</I>&gt;<i> data (*).  Once I've written 10 TiB of data, I can delete files to create 
</I>&gt;<i> more space.  This is like having a 10 TiB hard disk to store data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	(*) real-life systems have some complications, but considering an
</I>&gt;<i> 		idealised storage system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   b. consumable: I'm allocated 10 TiB storage.  I can store files up to that 
</I>&gt;<i> size of data.  I can delete the files if I like, but deleting files doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> allow me to store more files.  Once I've used up that 10 TiB of storage, I 
</I>&gt;<i> have to ask for more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps option b. seems a little crazy, but it might be how StorageShares 
</I>&gt;<i> would work with archival WORM media).
</I>
That example proves my point: one cannot predict/prescribe how a particular
size attribute will be affected when a file is stored or deleted!

&gt;<i> It seems that everyone in HEP assumes a partitioning model but I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen it stated anywhere.  Other communities might assume a different 
</I>&gt;<i> model.  If we want information to be sharable (or mergable) I think we should 
</I>&gt;<i> state clearly any assumptions we're making.  If we don't assume anything, 
</I>&gt;<i> that should be noted too, so people consuming information know that either:
</I>&gt;<i> 	1. they can't assume what happens, or
</I>&gt;<i> 	2. if they assume something, that it's a WLCG convention that they must 
</I>&gt;<i> revisit when combining data with other information sources.
</I>
We must explicitly mention that in general any of the various sizes may be
an approximation whose exact behavior depends on the underlying technology,
implementation, load, concurrent usage, ...
A grid may impose strict(er) requirements on the behavior.
GLUE just provides a &quot;coat rack&quot; for information.
Thanks,
	Maarten

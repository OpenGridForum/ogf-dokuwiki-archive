&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I am getting actuators wrong ... it could be, I like the Sun  
</I>&gt;<i> API, and they use actuators. But, actually, actuators don't seem  
</I>&gt;<i> that great, and they have filtered down into the verb part of the  
</I>&gt;<i> noun-attribute-verb model. And so, I think it is interesting to  
</I>&gt;<i> explore other ways of doing it, which address (these overlap)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - async concerns
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Status/error fields would be one simple solution to this problem -  
</I>&gt;<i> we already have HTTP 20x error codes to indicate that something is  
</I>&gt;<i> indeed async.
</I>
I think that is a good way.

The thing (that I understand about the actuator) approach, or rather I  
have not seen documented anywhere, was that POSTing to an actuator URI  
doesn't seem to create a resource anywhere. So, we can't do that right  
now.

OK, maybe that is something for OCCI 2.0, but why not do it now ?

&gt;<i> An eventlog extension is another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - error reporting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - offering porential of something more than just pressing a button  
</I>&gt;<i> (move a few dials then press a button, for ex)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is likely to be an absolute requirement - I don't want to have  
</I>&gt;<i> to press the start button 50 times to get 50 instances so there will  
</I>&gt;<i> need to be some way to create-en-masse for a start (probably with  
</I>&gt;<i> the flexibility of ranges ala amazon). I may also need to specify  
</I>&gt;<i> cold start vs warm start (e.g. with or without state). I've not  
</I>&gt;<i> really even started thinking about this yet, beyond knowing that  
</I>&gt;<i> there are a few potential solutions.
</I>
So, actuators don't seem to cover this (?)

Modeling state discovery *and* request as part of a model does seems  
to be a good alternative.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A different perspective is that in the state should be part of the  
</I>&gt;<i> model, not as a enumerable defined in a registry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, this is the more formal approach but it's also more rigid/ 
</I>&gt;<i> brittle. As we can't hope to predict every state that will ever  
</I>&gt;<i> exist, least of all in a fashion that is understandable/acceptable  
</I>&gt;<i> to everyone, we need to be flexible.
</I>
Yes, but, the people need to conform to some extent. That's why we are  
having this JSON vs ATOM discussion, right ? They also need to conform  
to a basic state model, and then allow states to be specialized if  
necessary. Don't you actually get this if you have  state modeled as  
part of a class model; a simple one that everyone can live with -  
rather like the one in the OGF Reference Model - together with sub- 
classing for more specialist cases ?

So, generically processed by everything at some level. That takes care  
of brittleness, right ?

Roger

ps. Actually, I would've thought that having the state of something as  
a stream of updates inside an feed would appeal to a &quot;atom/atompp for  
occi&quot; proponent ?


&gt;<i> State diagrams are as much a personal preference, as evidenced by  
</I>&gt;<i> the many that exist for different projects - Microsoft vs VMware vs  
</I>&gt;<i> DMTF vs OGF being the ones I've looked at.
</I>

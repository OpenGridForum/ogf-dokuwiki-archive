It was great to meet you in Prague and discuss our respective goals... I was
happy to know that you guys were monitoring our progress and I really hope
we can deliver something useful for you sooner rather than later.

I think the main selling points for cloud providers like yourselves are:

   - Interoperability for the parts we care about while still allowing you
   room to innovate/differentiate (if we make it too tight the commoditisation
   takes over)... that translates to customers being able to migrate to you
   easily (which is a double edged sword in that if you fail to deliver they
   can leave you easier too) and perhaps more importantly more tools like
   desktop management clients and autonomic scaling (e.g. RightScale).
   - Access to enterprise users who are currently kicking the tyres with
   PoCs and pilots, but who will likely end up with a more &quot;enterprise&quot;
   solution like VMware provided by a traditional hosting provider. If we meet
   their needs then you'll gain access to a segment that you might not have
   otherwise been able to reach.

As usual open to 1 (or 2) on 1 calls with you/your staff for gathering
requirements and feedback but it'll have to wait until next week unless you
happen to be in Lisbon.

Cheers,

Sam

<PRE>Sam,

Painting this as a mere difference between angle brackets or curly braces
trivializes or avoids the central problem: the very tools you cite as
advantages of XML are, in my opinion, merely symptoms of the complexity
inherent in using XML, especially in the so-called &quot;enterprise
environment&quot;.  The question of maturity seems to be entirely about those
same tools, rather than about any concerns about JSON being a moving target
(it isn't).

Sun has provided a compelling example of how to use JSON in the construction
of a simple, RESTful cloud interface, yet all your arguments against it are
nebulous.  What _specific_ thing is it you believe meets these criteria:
 1) Is a concrete requirement of the core interface
 2) Is possible with XML (without dragging in the very baggage that has sunk
so many other &quot;enterprise&quot; protocols based on it)
 3) Is not possible with JSON

I am not talking nice-to-haves, here.  I mean real, protocol can't function
without it stuff, because if the core protocol _can_ function without a
feature, why on earth would you put it in?  I recommend the following
exercise:  divide the features into &quot;definitely need right now&quot;, &quot;might need
at some point&quot;, &quot;definitely won't need&quot;.  Discard all but the first category
in creating the core protocol, compare the result to the Sun API, smile with
recognition, adopt it as the base, move on.

&gt;<i> Morning all,

</I>&gt;<i> feel a lot like we've taken a trip back to 2006&lt;<A HREF="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/12/and_the_winner_of_the_json_vs.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/12/and_the_winner_of_the_json_vs.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> As one person pointed out in private it's clear there is now a good deal of
</I>&gt;<i> backlash against &quot;XML/SOAP/complexity&quot; - apparently enough to consider
</I>&gt;<i> wiping the slate clean of many years of hard (albeit thus far largely
</I>&gt;<i> futile) work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not particularly religious about the matter either way (my only vested
</I>&gt;<i> interest is in the time I've volunteered to date and what little I have left
</I>&gt;<i> in which to deliver results) but I do think the model is *far* more
</I>&gt;<i> important and worthy of detailed discussion than the protocol. I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> neither XML nor Atom impinge on anything we've needed to codify so far and
</I>&gt;<i> once you have to reach for a library (as you do in both cases) the machines
</I>&gt;<i> could talk pig latin to each other for all we care. The primary (and only
</I>&gt;<i> valid IMO) objection to XML is that it tends to be abused more often than
</I>&gt;<i> not, but zero examples of such abuse in our designs have been given and
</I>&gt;<i> we've agreed to limit ourselves to an essentially flat structure (that must
</I>&gt;<i> be able to be cleanly represented in alternative formats including JSON and
</I>&gt;<i> TXT) so this is a non-issue anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at the practicalities, XML is very mature with plenty of expertise
</I>&gt;<i> and tools (from editors to application accelerators/firewalls) available for
</I>&gt;<i> it while JSON is a rapidly developing new kid on the block (or is at least
</I>&gt;<i> perceived to be by enterprise users - and perception/marketing is half of
</I>&gt;<i> the battle). There are a lot of things we can do today with XML that we
</I>&gt;<i> can't [and may never be able to] do with JSON such as transparently
</I>&gt;<i> embedding supporting formats like OVF (which like it or not is going to have
</I>&gt;<i> its time in the sun), transforming it to whatever format(s) we like in a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanical, platform independent fashion and serialising, encrypting and
</I>&gt;<i> signing it (for storage, queueing, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Atom itself is already arguably the single most successful &quot;cloud&quot; standard
</I>&gt;<i> with Google using it for pretty much every public facing interface (protocol
</I>&gt;<i> buffers are used under the covers for efficiency) and every feed on the web
</I>&gt;<i> is using it (or something like it). There is a good deal of overlap with
</I>&gt;<i> whatever domain specific language we might have invented ourselves (I know
</I>&gt;<i> because I tried this before [re]discovering Atom) and it is a better fit
</I>&gt;<i> than you might first think - feel free to go through the exercise if you
</I>&gt;<i> need to see for yourself. In terms of the future it's also far more
</I>&gt;<i> extensible in that adding new resources et al to a domain specific language
</I>&gt;<i> would almost certainly require us to reconvene to create OCCI 2.0, while
</I>&gt;<i> extensions can be safely implemented (and validated) without risk to the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the spec; this is not something I see as being particularly well
</I>&gt;<i> handled with JSON now or any time soon. Furthermore, things we currently
</I>&gt;<i> take for granted behind the scenes with XML (like being able to pass around
</I>&gt;<i> a DOM object and have different components update it as necessary before
</I>&gt;<i> handing the result to a renderer) are not possible unless you happen to be
</I>&gt;<i> writing JavaScript (one of the only languages where JSON is a first class
</I>&gt;<i> citizen rather than a third party extension).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the current plan is to support multiple formats (even if we only
</I>&gt;<i> actually require one of them) while maintaining the ability to move
</I>&gt;<i> losslessly between them, there is nothing stopping us from shifting our
</I>&gt;<i> weight to the other foot if and when JSON matures. The web never mandated
</I>&gt;<i> the use of a single format so I don't see why we should start now (though
</I>&gt;<i> telling implementors they must support all of them is a tall order). In
</I>&gt;<i> terms of reaching a loose consensus I think the EH/GG guys will be satisfied
</I>&gt;<i> if we can get clean[er] transforms, Sun ought to be happy if we follow their
</I>&gt;<i> methodologies if not their exact protocol (e.g. single entry point,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;buttons&quot; for state changes, etc.), Google may well get on board if we make
</I>&gt;<i> it easy for them and I'll be satisfied if I don't have to throw away a
</I>&gt;<i> substantial base of work already completed as well as the opportunity to use
</I>&gt;<i> the myriad existing XML/Atom/GData tools and clients (remembering a domain
</I>&gt;<i> specific language starts with exactly zero implementations).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if someone *does* have a particularly strong fetish for curly
</I>&gt;<i> braces and cares to rewrite the spec as well as a reference implementation
</I>&gt;<i> and a bunch of transforms by next week then be my guest.

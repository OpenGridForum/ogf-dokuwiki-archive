<PRE>Sam, Andy,

Good dialogue.  It would be great if you could break out requirements
as they come up.

For example: requirement to cache. Use case: ... Possible solution(s):...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your efforts - I find it easiest to look at this rendering to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work out what it boils down to and I can't help but to notice there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already some strong similarities with Atom (as well as some serious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limitations courtesy the &quot;simplification&quot;):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] Compare atom to many other models and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy mapping. The rendering may not be perfect, I&#8217;ll be the first to admit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it J If there are other limitations do please list them. I&#8217;d be keen to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating our own protocol, from scratch, with our own ideas as to how things
</I>&gt;<i> should be represented, categoried, associated etc. significantly raises the
</I>&gt;<i> risk of failure as well as the barrier to entry - that's reason enough in
</I>&gt;<i> itself not to do it, particularly when perfectly good alternatives already
</I>&gt;<i> exist. My point is that your current proposal is very nearly Atom anyway so
</I>&gt;<i> why not just use it? Your &quot;simplification&quot; complicates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I tell the difference between resources without a unique identifier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Atom &quot;id&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] The current OCCI nouns/verbs/attributes do not specify this, hence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a requirement. I&#8217;ve only taken what&#8217;s on the wiki and worked with that along
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surely the requirement for a unique identifier for each resource is so
</I>&gt;<i> bleeding obvious that it's implicit... you can already add an &quot;id&quot; field.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I tell when the resource was updated (Atom &quot;updated&quot;) and/or what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version it is (ETag)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] Same as above
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an implementation issue - one of many that implementors will trip up
</I>&gt;<i> on as they try to turn our spec into reality. Actually it's worse than that
</I>&gt;<i> in that it may not appear until users try to deploy the resulting systems
</I>&gt;<i> and find that they do not perform adequately. Caching information also falls
</I>&gt;<i> squarely into the &quot;obvious&quot; category for me and this stuff is very hard to
</I>&gt;<i> get right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using HTTP as the meta-model for individual resources and Atom for
</I>&gt;<i> collections gives us immediate access to an entire Internet worth of
</I>&gt;<i> implementations and optimisations - am I the only one here who sees
</I>&gt;<i> significant benefit in being able to put reverse proxies in front of your
</I>&gt;<i> API servers for example? I doubt I'm the only person here implementing
</I>&gt;<i> systems at scale... this approach of moving away from a hard-wired RPC style
</I>&gt;<i> API to a loosely coupled document based system paves the way for extremely
</I>&gt;<i> scalable architectures - for example where nodes periodically PUT their
</I>&gt;<i> state for clients to GET resulting in the command &amp; control being little
</I>&gt;<i> more than a repository.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I find one or more resources by search/category/tag/etc.?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] See occi:Tag
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One global namespace for rudimentary tagging is not at all what I had in
</I>&gt;<i> mind - again this is a problem that is long since solved and one that gets
</I>&gt;<i> exponentially complicated with the number of items.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I represent a single object?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] See occi:Compute or indeed occi:Resource
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So these things can exist independently of groups? I'd have known that
</I>&gt;<i> already if it were a common format but here I have to resort to reading the
</I>&gt;<i> XSD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I differentiate between tag vocabularies - &quot;small&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;virtualmachine&quot; are talking about two completely different concepts (Atom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;category&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] J tag == folksonomy. I guess you are referring to ontology?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Taxonomy - a subtle but important difference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I create generic links to supporting resources e.g. screenshots,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consoles, etc. (Atom &quot;link&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] See my first answer. Also occi:Link &#8211; oops my bad this is there but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be xs:complexType not xs:attributeGroup. I&#8217;ll update this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is yet another reimplementation of an existing, well established
</I>&gt;<i> concept that developers will have to learn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I create associations with arbitrary resources e.g. users (Atom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;link&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] See first answer. Extend atom:linkType or simply import it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Arbitrary? I thought OCCI was focused on the specific domain of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Infrastructure and we spent time on extracting core nouns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just because you don't care who owns or has access to a resource doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean that I don't - rich ACLs are something that will need to be supportable
</I>&gt;<i> (if not directly supported) and I'm sure there will be many other examples.
</I>&gt;<i> Generic links are going to work better here, and we already have them for
</I>&gt;<i> free.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I carry critical information that we nonetheless consider out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scope (e.g. OVF)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] can introduce xsd:anyType into the model easily
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok so I've got an anyType and I want to know what it's for (relation) and
</I>&gt;<i> how to read it (content type) - how will that be expressed? Yet again, all
</I>&gt;<i> roads lead to Atom.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do we extend the spec? (e.g. rinse &amp; repeat)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] Extend the XSD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said. Anyway I've thus far managed to avoid having to touch XSD so I
</I>&gt;<i> guess we'll have to schedule an XSD vs RELAX NG schema war at some point
</I>&gt;<i> too... in any case better schema than no schema.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do vendors/users extend the spec? (e.g. namespaces?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] As above plus some notions of governance from OCCI, yet to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is the problem is already solved [by Atom] and we're going to have
</I>&gt;<i> to cover the same ground.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do I import/export resource(s) (e.g. OVA)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] Now we&#8217;re into application specific functionality/features&#8230;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something of an orthogonal for modelling activities. Perhaps closest here is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model transforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say that this requirement is extremely pertinent for model discussions -
</I>&gt;<i> it obviously needs to support this functionality somehow or it will be
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to get anything in/out of an implementation (and therefore to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve portability between them). Transforms are something else entirely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] The more requirements the better. In fact OCCI does not define the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base units of attribute values that are part of the model. I don&#8217;t think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these can be found within Atom. Perhaps there&#8217;s an XSD out there that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could import and reuse those based units (e.g. MB, MHz etc). Also it would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be nice to be able to add arbitrary infrastructure related parameters to any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entity in the model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your &quot;nice&quot; is my &quot;necessary&quot;. Units are optional - at the very least we
</I>&gt;<i> need to specify the smallest units (e.g. Mb for memory) but after that
</I>&gt;<i> making the protocol pretty [to humans] makes it harder to interpret [for
</I>&gt;<i> computers] - and therefore less interoperable. Jury's still out on this one
</I>&gt;<i> for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Following a (long) conversation over (numerous) beers with Alexis on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Friday I have come to the conclusion that the meta-model is quite separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the representation, which is to say that collections, organisation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> association, etc. can be done generically while providing a simple &quot;OCCI&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representation of the various resources is a domain-specific task.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] Meta-model constrains the model. The model defines how a model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance can be created. Representation is the model instance and can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendered. So in my view they are related, albeit through 2 levels of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indirection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does the proposed meta-model constrain the model?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the former (meta-model) HTTP and/or Atom clearly make the most sense
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but for the latter we need to be careful not to end up reinventing CIM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gary's list of network attributes gave me pause over the weekend and I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the best way to filter this is to consider what functionality is supplied
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than what functionality is demanded. That is to say, today public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cloud providers do IPv4 so we provide attributes for IPv4. If multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vendors do IPv6 we add IPv6. If nobody does IPX/SPX then too bad for those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who need it. This stuff still needs to go somewhere though, which is why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple representations are essential.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] I agree on this (being careful not extending CIM). In fact this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of OVF&#8217;s strengths. It&#8217;s quite easy to include elements and attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined in the RASD schema in OVF, allowing people extending OVF reach into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a huge library of entity definitions. Regarding IP issues and hence specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology dependencies, I remember you describing a solution where we not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concentrate on such details but rather assign compute resources (VM) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> networks by tag. Whatever came of that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something better appeared, along with the realisation that if we don't give
</I>&gt;<i> folks like SNIA a way to play then they'll blaze their own trail. In reality
</I>&gt;<i> it's not much more complicated - networks just became first class citizens
</I>&gt;<i> which allows for extensibility. Ditto for storage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it wasn't already clear, I'm very anti the approach of modeling the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem and blatting out one or more representations, irrespective of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delimiters used. A lot of good work has already been done on HTTP and Atom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meta-models and giving everyone else the forks by creating yet another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domain-specific language is not something I plan to be in any way associated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with... the result will almost certainly be an interop train wreck not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unlike WS-*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] The modelling approach through to XSD is just one that was followed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the Atom folks in one way or another to arrive at a domain-specific model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the publishing and manipulation of content. If you don&#8217;t model the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem &#8211; even on paper, napkin or beer mat how do you expect to fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand it? /joke If you wish not to be domain-specific then might I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> introduce you to my little friend void* :-D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Atom is quite clearly not domain-specific (as evidenced by its rapid,
</I>&gt;<i> widespread adoption in the cloud space for a myriad applications)... the
</I>&gt;<i> concepts apply to any information organisation activity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With atom imho if you want to use it other than publish blog articles then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you will have to create something more domain specific &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempting to cout my void* to atom:entry and hope someone understand the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content within atom:entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do need to have a simple &quot;OCCI&quot; format to represent functionality that
</I>&gt;<i> has multiple implementations, agreed. That said, if we palm the metadata
</I>&gt;<i> (id, updated, etc.) and metamodel (links) off to HTTP/Atom as suggested by
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis last week then the resulting format ends up being a lot more like
</I>&gt;<i> what Chris and Richard from ElasticHosts were pushing for. In fact it gets
</I>&gt;<i> so simple that key-value pairs in $PREFERRED_FORMAT makes the most sense,
</I>&gt;<i> and having multiple formats available for interop becomes feasible. This
</I>&gt;<i> fits with the HTML forms model too, which is also highly advantageous -
</I>&gt;<i> creating and updating resources is as simple as a HTML form submission with
</I>&gt;<i> no other formatting required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In summary I'd like to see us use Atom where absolutely necessary (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collections) and raw HTTP with multiple representations everywhere else. One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of those representations can be a restricted syntax based on features with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple deployments (but users would also be free to send/receive OVF or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even their own home grown guff if they want).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [AE: ] That&#8217;s perfectly fine but what will those representations look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like? Who will define them? How will you verify them? If we&#8217;re not using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even Atom, what will it be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only representation we care about is the simplest representation
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to create resources - cores, speed, memory etc. for compute, size
</I>&gt;<i> for storage and ip, netmask and gateway for network, etc. The others will
</I>&gt;<i> use existing standards:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OVF for portable workloads
</I>&gt;<i> VMX et al for proprietary workloads
</I>&gt;<i> PNG/JPG/etc. for screenshots
</I>&gt;<i> VNC/RDP/SSH/etc. for consoles
</I>&gt;<i> PDF/ODF for documentation
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given this representation will then end up being key-value pairs we can
</I>&gt;<i> easily specify (and implement) text, json and xml renderings for interop,
</I>&gt;<i> while others who care about performance can use things like protocol buffers
</I>&gt;<i> for talking to the nodes (XML parsing overhead can be non-negligible for
</I>&gt;<i> automated workloads at scale even if not a problem for most tasks).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of the XSD sometime. This XSD can be found here [2]. Now I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class myself as a XSD expert so any comments, updates etc are appreciated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From this XSD I was able to generate an API to create and manipulate an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here [3]. It's Java and uses XMLBeans[4], but there are many other libraries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out there that will allow the generation of an API in languages such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python[5], Ruby[6], CSharp[7] (typically any language that has SOAP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libraries will have an XSD class generator). After rendering the in-memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model the XML rendering is specific but adheres to the OCCI model schema and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be viewed here[8]. Again how things appear in the XML can be tweaked via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iteration of the schema. For those JSON peeps out there there's an already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XSLT transform sheets out there that will convert this XML to JSON using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different conventions [9][10].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This model is abstract in a sense it does not import any dependencies,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as Atom. @Sam perhaps you could take what I've done and either by way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of model inheritance or composition show how Atom would integrate with this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My view on Atom is that it is useful as a wrapper to renderings of OCCI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model instances. If I wanted to publish an OCCI model via Atom then I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insert a model instance rendering into an atom:entry element (note we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include JSON via CDATA but this is where JSON perhaps gets a little ugly).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would be OCCI using Atom by way of composition and would allow both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Atom and OCCI live harmoniously together or separately and not require Atom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies should that be the choice of a provider. What's important is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the OCCI model be it via Atom or something else could be understood by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a receiving system. Using Atom with OCCI by way of inheritance makes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previous &quot;with or without&quot; approach a little more difficult as there's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard-dependency on Atom.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Atom reminds me somewhat of WS-Agreement, SOAP etc. It doesn't solve your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domain-specific model problems (i.e. what you are trying to represent -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OCCI==Infrastructure), only provide a means to send this content about and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanisms supporting this but perhaps not directly to the model contained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as content. We still have to understand and represent our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noun/verb/attribute triplets. Atom doesn't really help out bar the features
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it offers by way of sitting on top of HTTP. Now of course you can extend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Atom base types (in fact AFAIK they're just xs:complexTypes W3C XSD types)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but the point is you have to extend them to _something_. That something is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your domain specific model. There is value however in Atom, not from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model point of view - it's a very simple model. The value in Atom is in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directions the specifications gives pertaining to Atom service behaviour.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another way to view Atom is the interoperability glue in between the now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> almost commonly accepted cloud stack of Infrastructure -&gt; Platform -&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Service. This is where OCCI could learn quite an amount but when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider that the basis of these behaviours are steeply entrenched in REST
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design principles it's easy to see 1) why Atom is attractive 2) that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't necessarily need Atom to have correct and/or standard service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviour - just adopt good, sound REST design principles!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On more specifics and related to the attributes of each noun, we are still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather under-specified especially in the Storage and Network nouns. @Richard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and @Gary (in separate threads) started a useful discussion on attributes

<PRE>Sam,

The problem is that we don't have something concrete on the wiki that
has the following properties:

1.
(a) is agreed on
OR
(b) is a clear proposal

2.
has consensus meaning support from multiple parties willing to
implement and use - we don't want 'outsiders' we want convergence

I am trying to PROPOSE a concrete course of action.  I really truly
appreciate the work you are putting in, especially the drive to work
with EH and Andy from <A HREF="http://www.ogf.org/mailman/listinfo/occi-wg">SLA at SOI.</A>  But I don't see that work necessarily
conflicting with what I am proposing.

As as aside, with all due respect:

It does not help when you say, one week, &quot;it really doesn't get any
simpler than this&quot; and then simplify it and again say &quot;it really
doesn't get any simpler than this&quot;.  Please try to understand that we
don't have full unimpeded access to all your thought processes, and
consensus will arise from your clarifying them.

Instead of chucking around phrases like 'vendor capture' and 'rubber
stamping', why don't you tell us what Sun, GoGrid, etc, don't do to
meet your requirement.  Then we can make a better open document that
meets the needs of multiple providers and users, and has their
consensual buy in and support.  We have the pieces of the puzzle right
in front of us.

If you object to my proposal then propose an alternative!

alexis

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's now 3am where I am and I've been on and off the phone all night with
</I>&gt;<i> Andy getting ourselves in sync (we are, after all, doing the lion's share of
</I>&gt;<i> the work). We've come to the conclusion that a simple key-value format
</I>&gt;<i> originally proposed by ElasticHosts is feasible if supported by HTTP (for
</I>&gt;<i> individual resources) and/or Atom (for collections of resources) for the
</I>&gt;<i> meta-model. This is basically illustrated in the wiki and is a significant
</I>&gt;<i> simplification/improvement on what I had previously proposed - at least all
</I>&gt;<i> the extra discussion has been useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it's key-value (links, categories, etc. are delegated to the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> protocol(s)) we have a further optimisation of being able to use HTML forms
</I>&gt;<i> directly - so a client need not even understand the OCCI representation(s)
</I>&gt;<i> if it knows how to submit a form. It really doesn't get any easier than that
</I>&gt;<i> and we get the ability to submit e.g. OVF/OVA files for free - I'm guessing
</I>&gt;<i> (hoping) the ElasticHosts guys will be happy when they get back from their
</I>&gt;<i> long weekend as it was their feedback that primarily drove the revision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All technical issues aside, and speaking as an outsider, I'd advise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members of this group to rally around whatever your co-chairs propose,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they're trying to get you from nowhere to somewhere. &#160;-Tim
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having worked on this project full time and then some since March I take
</I>&gt;<i> some amount of offense to your claim that we are &quot;nowhere&quot;, especially
</I>&gt;<i> considering that the proposal you're supporting &quot;as an outsider&quot; to get
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;somewhere&quot; is the adoption and rubber stamping of your own API (not
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting that one of the two co-chairs who &quot;strongly supports this course
</I>&gt;<i> of action&quot; happens to be another Sun employee). If that ends up being the
</I>&gt;<i> case even in light of the unresolved patent problems first raised over 2
</I>&gt;<i> months ago then I'll be out of here quicker than you can say &quot;vendor
</I>&gt;<i> capture&quot;.

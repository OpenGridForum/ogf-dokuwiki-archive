&gt;<i> So examples of the requisite extensibility include creating complex
</I>&gt;<i> storage and networking resources and importing the (large) existing
</I>&gt;<i> base of compute resources (in OVF or other legacy formats). It is
</I>&gt;<i> without doubt better to have the option and not use it than give it up
</I>&gt;<i> and find we need it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the componentisation of implementations, it's highly unlikely that
</I>&gt;<i> the best architecture is to use the same platforms for everything from
</I>&gt;<i> controllers to monitoring to billing to security etc. in which case it
</I>&gt;<i> is extremely useful to be able to pass your messages around and build
</I>&gt;<i> them iteratively. JSON is great for [de]serialising objects in memory
</I>&gt;<i> but is actually more troublesome than XML for this particular use
</I>&gt;<i> case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess a lot of this comes down to the public vs private debate that
</I>&gt;<i> Ignacio captured nicely in a recent blog post. I prefer not to
</I>&gt;<i> differentiate and have my money on hybrid architectures. As a
</I>&gt;<i> potential client implementor I'd mych prefer not to have to implement
</I>&gt;<i> OCCi *and* vCloud^W OVF2.0 for things like that function people are
</I>&gt;<i> calling 'cloudbursting'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With XML we can be light for light users and as fat as need be for the
</I>&gt;<i> more demanding ones (like my enterprise clients who are primarily from
</I>&gt;<i> the CAC 40 - top 40 companies in France).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW I actually dislike XML as much as the next guy but I'm also very
</I>&gt;<i> practical and like to avoid cutting off my nose to spite my face.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sam -- for the record, I find blanket assertions such as &quot;an essential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enterprise feature&quot; to be problematic.  I'm about as enterprisey as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could possibly be, and you are definitely *not* speaking on my behalf
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've no doubt that you are speaking for someone or something that relates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to your experience, and an alternative phrasing such as &quot;an essential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature for the enterprise customers I work with&quot; would clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> articulate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that.  But I&quot;m here to tell you -- there's a large and valid population
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folk who self-identify as &quot;enterprise&quot; who disagree with much of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasoning.  Here are some examples:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- &quot;The schema is a WiP for a start, and an essential enterprise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, it is not.  In my world, we are busy trying to learn many lessons
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Web, only some of which fit within the scope of the term REST.  One
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the most important lessons we are trying to internalise and apply is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priori schemas are sometimes much more trouble than they are worth.  In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that world, among other things, there are any number of examples of cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where I am trying to figure out how to *store my data* without an a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priori
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schema, because that confers on me all sorts of advantages which seem to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move me an inch or two towards the holy grail of disposable software.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can assure you that, in those sorts of contexts, the idea of going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lengths, only to move data to and from those schema-less data stores via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;standard&quot; mechanisms that impose one of its own can provoke gales of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (slightly bitter) laughter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- &quot;Our success *requires* playing nice with OVF. And SNIA. And probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bunch of other stuff in the future&quot; followed then by &quot;Our spec will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concise anyway given how we use XML in the lightest way possible&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It worries me that you may not see the contradiction lurking in those two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statements.  At best, these statements have a high probability of both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being true only at a given point in time; one quite early in the life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cycle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of OCCI (which, of course, is where we are).  Over time, it is *very*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unlikely (verging on the impossible, IMO) that both statements can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *remain*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true.  This is because the imperative underlying each of these statements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is in direct conflict with the other -- &quot;playing nice with others&quot; is in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct conflict with &quot;concise&quot;.  We all seem to be in agreement about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merits of concise -- the disagreement revolves around the degree of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;playing nice with others&quot;, and / or preparing for playing nice with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others.  I think there is a strong argument to be made for making a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deliberate decision, at this point in the lifecycle, to *not* make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> playing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice with others a goal.  Explicitly -- IOW, making it a non-goal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, focus on what I thought this group was chartered to do -- the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplest possible common representation of what's already out there,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working.  The &quot;others&quot; be damned.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- &quot;Cloud architectures are complex with many differs t extensions having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to contribute to answers. JSON does not lend itself to this kind of thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so it's actually (a lot) more work for implementors&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That sounds, to this &quot;enterprise voice&quot;, like a feature, not a bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Constraints are good.  I like constraints.  You have not yet convinced me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the &quot;extensions&quot; you refer to here are critical to the core of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aforementioned simplest possible common representation of what's already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out there, working.  Instead, the impression I get is that these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or even the possibility of having them) serves primarily the &quot;play nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with others&quot; (non) goal.  Since I don't think worrying about playing nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with others is a good idea, imposing a contstraint that makes it harder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do seems like a good idea to me.  Helps focus on the core goal --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distractions fall away.  In my experience, that's a design approach that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in turn, produces *very* robust artefacts -- ones on which it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequently relatively easy to build more stuff (to play with other, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example).  Doing things the other way round (trying to anticipate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account for possible &quot;extensions&quot;), in my experience, too often leads to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fragile, brittle designs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This argument, OTOH:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- &quot;Agreed but that was before we had an almost complete spec, a rough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reference implementation complete with mechanical transforms to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested formats and the start of a HTML interface for good measure. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JSON we have nothing&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... is quite compelling, and in my view.  And that may outweigh all other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerns, given the desire to hold the date.  Dunno.

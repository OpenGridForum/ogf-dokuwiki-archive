</I>
&gt;<i> b) &#160; &#160; &#160;Interop vs Integration
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Agreed. Just as one more POV, interop tests the functionality
</I>&gt;<i> while integration tests the ability to work with various systems. So
</I>&gt;<i> interop first, with one format, is good.

</I>&gt;<i> understood the essential domain complexity (at least the current state
</I>&gt;<i> of the art, as Tim pointed out a while ago)
</I>
Thank-you.


&gt;<i> c) &#160; &#160; &#160;&quot;Transport&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Interesting pointer to AMQP. What about XMPP as the substrate ?
</I>&gt;<i> (Of course, it could mean XML ;o))
</I>
I was just using AMQP experiences as an example of dealing with
interop issues in a standard.  I don't think OCCI needs a substrate
beyond HTTP.  XMPP and AMQP are interesting technologies but way out
of scope for anything I personally think OCCI needs to worry about in
2009.



&gt;<i> d) &#160; &#160; &#160;CDATA
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The CDATA issue pointed by Sam is an interesting one. I was also
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of the implications and had the question whether we plan to
</I>&gt;<i> chuck OVF through our APIs? I think, we can take a position like html -
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. use href mechanism as far as possible and base64 for the rest.
</I>
Yes, I think we need to think about OVF very carefully.  I don't think
OVF needs to be part of the interop profile because to do so would
bring too much baggage.  But I do think OVF should be integrated with
and how to do that is well worth discussing.  If our core format is
'flat' then OVF will have to be attached, regardless of whether we use
JSON or XML.





&gt;<i> e) &#160; &#160; &#160;OGF-25 Presentation
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most probably we will not get to agreement on all the important
</I>&gt;<i> points by OGF-25. We don't have to. At GGF-25, we present the state of
</I>&gt;<i> our work - demark what we have agreed upon, and the alternatives we are
</I>&gt;<i> working on. And until 1.0, things will be unstable anyway. Plus we can
</I>&gt;<i> honestly represent the different camps and seek insights from the crowd.
</I>&gt;<i> So I do not think GGF-25 is in critical path in anyway.
</I>
Cool.

I would like to see a draft set of verbs and nouns, which is what I
have been asking for from the start.  I think the data model is next.
We present what we have agreed on when asked to show a draft.


&gt;<i> f) &#160; &#160; &#160;Disagreeing with Sam
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I also agree that we should not en-masse disagree with Sam. But
</I>&gt;<i> as Alexis' points out, the minimal scope vs. maximum coverage is the
</I>&gt;<i> key. We can restrict or curtail the APIs to a minimum set - without any
</I>&gt;<i> reduction in functionality; for example use hrefs instead of embedding.
</I>&gt;<i> Constraints are wonderful thongs !
</I>
Thongs? ;-)

I don't think we are en masse disagreeing with Sam.  I think Sam has
done some good work and is defending several points concurrently, that
are a mix of his own view, prior art, and stuff that others strongly
agree on.  I do think we need to separate out the strands though.


&gt;<i> Cheers &amp; have a nice day
</I>
You too!

If you can help Richard and Chris, please do so :-)

</I>&gt;<i> |Subject: [occi-wg] thought on interoperability vs. integration
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Thanks for a thought-provoking week of emails on the OCCI-WG list.
</I>&gt;<i> |Especially thanks to Sam, Richard, Ben and Tim for laying out a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> |the issues.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |One link that I found useful was this:
</I>&gt;<i> |<A HREF="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud</A> where we
</I>&gt;<i> |find the following statement:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |---
</I>&gt;<i> |if Cloud technology is going to take off, there'll have to be a
</I>&gt;<i> |competitive ecosystem; so that when you bet on a service provider, if
</I>&gt;<i> |the relationship doesn't work out there's a way to take your business
</I>&gt;<i> |to another provider with relatively little operational pain. Put
</I>&gt;<i> |another way: no lock-in. &#160;... I got all excited about this back in
</I>&gt;<i> |January at that Cloud Interop session. Anant Jhingran, an IBM VIP,
</I>&gt;<i> |spoke up and said &quot;Customers don't want interoperability, they want
</I>&gt;<i> |integration.&quot; ... &#160;&quot;Bzzzzzzzzzt! Wrong!&quot; I thought. But then I
</I>&gt;<i> |realized he was only half wrong; anyone going down this road needs
</I>&gt;<i> |integration and interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i> |---
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |What we have been discussing is &quot;for customers&quot;. &#160;So it is about both
</I>&gt;<i> |of these things:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Interoperability (&quot;interop&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> |* Integration
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |This made me realise that our OCCI discussions have correctly been
</I>&gt;<i> |about both issues. &#160;But, incorrectly, we have been commingling the
</I>&gt;<i> |two. &#160;For example a person will say &quot;you need X for interop&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i> |reply will be &quot;but you need Y&quot; when in fact Y is for integration. &#160;And
</I>&gt;<i> |vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |This is a problem for us because it leads to confusion. &#160;But it's a
</I>&gt;<i> |symptom of a larger problem which is that interop and integration have
</I>&gt;<i> |opposite requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Interop is about reducing the entropy in a general purpose system
</I>&gt;<i> |down to some level of behavioural invariance. &#160;This minimises the cost
</I>&gt;<i> |of meeting the defined behaviour correctly, and minimises the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> |different behaviours breaking interop. &#160;This is in turn about having a
</I>&gt;<i> |defined behaviour (in some format) and minimising its scope.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Integration is about minimising the frictions between (a) the
</I>&gt;<i> |general purpose system and (b) any specific purpose external system
</I>&gt;<i> |that may be coupled to it. &#160;It is also, often, about maximising the
</I>&gt;<i> |number of specific systems (or &quot;features&quot;) that may be connected.
</I>&gt;<i> |Since we don't know ex ante what those are, this tends to maximise
</I>&gt;<i> |scope (eg &quot;feature creep&quot;). &#160;Too much specificity is the same as
</I>&gt;<i> |complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Because interop requires minimal scope, and integration pushes for
</I>&gt;<i> |maximal scope, they are in tension.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |They are BOTH about simplicity. &#160;Simplicity cannot be invoked on its
</I>&gt;<i> |own, as a reason for preferring interop over integration:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Interop is about simplicity of definition
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Integration is about simplicity of end use
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |BUT
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Interop simplicity is ex ante
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Integration simplicity is ex post
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |We cannot predict all ex post issues, but we can try and make simple
</I>&gt;<i> |definitions ex ante. &#160;I argue below this means we have to have ONE
</I>&gt;<i> |definition.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |So let's look at interop first:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |It's really important that interop be based on defined behaviour. &#160;Or
</I>&gt;<i> |it cannot be verified. &#160;Lack of verifiability is almost always a
</I>&gt;<i> |symptom that something is opaque, complex and ambiguous, which will
</I>&gt;<i> |break interop in subtle ways that cannot be seen in advance (due to
</I>&gt;<i> |the opacity). &#160;This later leads to brittleness when interop and
</I>&gt;<i> |integration are attempted in practice; and that leads to expensive
</I>&gt;<i> |patching at all levels, ... which is one thing that WS-* exhibits.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |NOTE 1 on WS-* ---- IMO this was not accidental, and due to focussing
</I>&gt;<i> |on solving integration before solving interop. &#160;IIRC, the first WS-*
</I>&gt;<i> |was an Interop committee to fix minor vendor mismatches and versioning
</I>&gt;<i> |issues in prior WS protocols such as WSDL and SOAP. &#160;The formalisms of
</I>&gt;<i> |WSDL and SOAP were not precise enough to spot these issues upfront, so
</I>&gt;<i> |they were left until it was too late.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Now let's look at the implications of having a definition of behaviour:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |You cannot define a system using multiple definitions. &#160;You have to
</I>&gt;<i> |have one definition, preferably in a formalism that admits of
</I>&gt;<i> |automatic conformance testing. &#160;In the case of data formats, this
</I>&gt;<i> |leads us to three possible choices:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |1) We remove data formats from the interop profile. &#160;They are not part
</I>&gt;<i> |of interop. &#160;Data interop is excluded. &#160;Data payloads are opaque
</I>&gt;<i> |blobs.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |OR
</I>&gt;<i> |2) We have one data format that can be defined unambiguously.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |OR
</I>&gt;<i> |3) We have multiple formats and derive them from a single unambiguous
</I>&gt;<i> |definition using canonical, verifiable, automatable, mappings. &#160;This
</I>&gt;<i> |definition can either be in a new format which we invent (option 3a)
</I>&gt;<i> |or it can be in an existing format (option 3b).
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |I am going to rule out option (3a) on grounds of time and due to the
</I>&gt;<i> |prevalence of existing candidates.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Also, I think choice (1) is a complete cop-out -- I don't see how we
</I>&gt;<i> |can claim 'useful' interop without data interop. &#160;This leaves options
</I>&gt;<i> |(2) and (3b). &#160;BOTH of these options require one format.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |By occam's razor, option 2 is preferable on grounds of simplicity -
</I>&gt;<i> |option (3b) does not add anything except one mapping for every extra
</I>&gt;<i> |format that is based on the core definition. &#160;Such complexity MUST be
</I>&gt;<i> |deferred as long as possible, and MAY be pushed into integration use
</I>&gt;<i> |cases. &#160;The latter is preferable. &#160;Complexity MAY be added later if
</I>&gt;<i> |necessary and then, reluctantly.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |As a general observation if you have complexity (entropy) in a system,
</I>&gt;<i> |it is very hard to take out. &#160;It may permeate the system at all
</I>&gt;<i> |levels. &#160;Removal of the complexity is known as 'complete refactoring'.
</I>&gt;<i> | This is a bad outcome. &#160;Even worse is when refactoring cannot be done
</I>&gt;<i> |for commercial reasons, eg because the systems are in production.
</I>&gt;<i> |Then the complexity must be encapsulated and hidden. &#160;Attempts to wrap
</I>&gt;<i> |complex behaviours in simpler packaging usually fail.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |NOTE 2 on WS-* ---- This tried to do too much and ended up trying to
</I>&gt;<i> |wrap the complexity in simple packaging. &#160;This usually fails to work
</I>&gt;<i> |as we have seen.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Another general observation:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Integration requires interop, ie. the use of a common general
</I>&gt;<i> |interop model; otherwise it is piecemeal and pointless. &#160;Example - the
</I>&gt;<i> |old 'integration brokers' that had N*N connections to maintain, and
</I>&gt;<i> |which got replaced by N connections to a common system.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* But you can have interop without integration - it just means 'you
</I>&gt;<i> |have a smaller audience'. &#160;This is fine because you can always grow
</I>&gt;<i> |your audience by integrating more case with the interoperating core.
</I>&gt;<i> |It is easier to do that when the interoperating core is
</I>&gt;<i> |programmatically simple (as in low entropy, small code blocks, easy to
</I>&gt;<i> |test conformance to the definition).
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |I would like to add some observations from the world of AMQP...
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |AMQP-1) It is a protocol with one simple common data format - it gets
</I>&gt;<i> |that right. &#160;We leave it to integration products and services to
</I>&gt;<i> |support data formats at the edge (eg &quot;ESBs&quot;). &#160;OCCI should not be like
</I>&gt;<i> |an ESB - that is for products and services in the integration
</I>&gt;<i> |business.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |AMQP-2) That AMQP data format is not XML - see below for more thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> |on that. &#160;XML can be carried as an attached payload (just as it can be
</I>&gt;<i> |in the JSON case btw).
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |AMQP-3) The 0-8 and 0-9 specs took 18 months of production use to show
</I>&gt;<i> |up the many very tiny interop bugs. &#160;We used those to create 0-9-1
</I>&gt;<i> |which does have interop (we have tested this) and is only 40 pages
</I>&gt;<i> |long. &#160;This would not have been possible with a complex spec. &#160;It
</I>&gt;<i> |would not have been possible with multiple data formats.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |AMQP-4) The 0-10 spec was focussed on supporting a lot of use cases eg
</I>&gt;<i> |&quot;integrate with multiple transport formats including SCTP and TCP and
</I>&gt;<i> |UDP&quot; and adding lots of features at all levels (eg JMS, support for
</I>&gt;<i> |hardware, ..). &#160;That spec is really complicated and nearly 300 pages
</I>&gt;<i> |long. &#160;Some great new ideas are in it, but it's long and in my own
</I>&gt;<i> |opinion not supportive of two interoperating implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |AMQP-5) All these painful lessons have taken the AMQP working group to
</I>&gt;<i> |a much happier place with AMQP 1.0 which tries to simplify everything
</I>&gt;<i> |by taking stuff out that is not needed for interop, plus refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> |(see above my comments on how removing entropy is hard) and clean-up.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |All of the above has taken time because we did not learn from WS-*.
</I>&gt;<i> |We did too much too fast and confused interop with integration. &#160;We
</I>&gt;<i> |are back on track now.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Now to the issue of data formats. &#160;I have already argued that FOR
</I>&gt;<i> |INTEROP, there must be one definition. &#160;I argued that the best way to
</I>&gt;<i> |do this is via a suitable single format. &#160;We can support as many
</I>&gt;<i> |recommended ways as we like FOR INTEGRATION ... and they can be
</I>&gt;<i> |evolved over time.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Here is my 2c on XML.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |XML-1) XML lets you do too much - because of namespaces and xsd it is
</I>&gt;<i> |in effect multiple formats. &#160;This is bad - we want a single, testable,
</I>&gt;<i> |constrained definition for data interop.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |XML-2) To enforce compliance with a simple XML definition, you need to
</I>&gt;<i> |have an extra definition of a well formed 'small' document. &#160;But
</I>&gt;<i> |creating a new definition of a data format in XML is equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> |defining a new data format, the same as 'option 3a' above. &#160;But that
</I>&gt;<i> |option was ruled out above, on grounds of time constraint.. provided
</I>&gt;<i> |that a suitable alternative exists already (see JSON claims below).
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |NOTE 3 on WS-* ---- IMHO a third reason why WS-* failed to be simple
</I>&gt;<i> |enough to get happy, quick and wide adoption, is that (XML-1) issue
</I>&gt;<i> |left too much data integration in the hands of customers, because
</I>&gt;<i> |vendors could not produce useful products when XML could be all things
</I>&gt;<i> |to all people. &#160;By not delivering on data integration, it became hard
</I>&gt;<i> |to deliver on the promise of integration at all. &#160;And recall that
</I>&gt;<i> |lowering integration costs was the selling point...
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |So let's get INTEROP right and then do INTEGRATION.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Interop requires:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |* Model - yes
</I>&gt;<i> |* Data format - one definition
</I>&gt;<i> |* Metadata - ? tbd
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |As an aside - I think that GData is the nuts but it is also really an
</I>&gt;<i> |*integration techonology*.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |Now, here are some claims about JSON:
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |JSON-1) Sun have demonstrated that it is plausible as a data model for
</I>&gt;<i> |a cloud API. &#160;That makes it plausible for us to ask: can it be used as
</I>&gt;<i> |the core definition for interop?
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |JSON-2) It is lower entropy than XML. &#160;This makes it easy to test
</I>&gt;<i> |conformance.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |JSON-3) This means we do things the right way round -- simpler 'ex
</I>&gt;<i> |ante' choices make it EASIER for us to extend and enhance the protocol
</I>&gt;<i> |on a by need basis. &#160;For example carrying OVF payloads, or other
</I>&gt;<i> |integration points. &#160;Many will be done by users.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |So my recommendation is that the best way to avoid WS-* outcomes is
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |A) Use one format for interop. &#160;Do interop first. &#160;Integration later.
</I>&gt;<i> |B) *At least for now* and *during the working draft* stage, to use JSON
</I>&gt;<i> |C) Other formats, for now, are &quot;integration&quot;. &#160;But we do interop first.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |OK.... I have to run off. &#160;I wrote this down in one go and don't have
</I>&gt;<i> |time to review it. &#160;Apologies for any mistakes in the presentation.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |What do you all think?

True. I've been working on the problem for about a year now so I guess that
counts for something, plus we're trying to find the consensus of a large and
growing number of existing APIs so we're not starting from scratch. If this
trivia doesn't derail us I'm expecting to have a rough spec and reference
implementation demo in place in time for my Europe tour starting Monday
week.


&gt;<i> &gt; Cool - can you or they contribute some use cases please?   We needs

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good point.  We have internal ones, had actually never thought of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1 that would be awesome - even if they're deidentified.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  They do not rely on interoperable models,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; they rely on agreement on what bytes I send you and what bytes you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; send me and what the meanings of the fields are.  ....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That sounds like a protocol mindset - consistent with your RFC comment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above.  But is OCCI a protocol?  Or is it an API?  What are your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thoughts here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the difference, to be honest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that when you say API people expect object models and
</I>&gt;<i> methods, and history should have taught us that those are very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to make portable across networks.  I confess to having a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol mindset since I'm a Web guy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can see some value in running a knife down the middle... hence the talk
about OCCI Core vs OCCI IaaS - where the former is a protocol ala HTTP
(actually based on HTTP + Atom + magic fairy dust for search, caching, etc.)
and the latter more an API that animates the resources with
controllers/actuators, network and storage links, attributes, etc.

&gt;<i> More generally: What is the right way to make a cloud interface more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like a protocol?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My opinion: Be RESTful, to the extent possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed, no point redoing what HTTP's already done.


&gt;<i> &gt; How would you recommend we deal with cases where XML is well supported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but JSON is not well known?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Many 'enterprises'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm... if you're in Java or Python or Ruby or of course JavaScript,
</I>&gt;<i> it's super-easy to consume and generate JSON.  If C# &amp; friends are
</I>&gt;<i> behind in this respect I can't see it staying that way for very long,
</I>&gt;<i> my impression is that those guys are serious about keeping up with the
</I>&gt;<i> joneses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's some ASP.NET stuff and some 3rd party stuff but it's certainly not
burnt into the DNA like XML is.


&gt;<i> &gt; If we 'went with JSON' then would it be plausible to have XML adaptors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for non-JSON settings?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifying the mapping is extra work.  I suggest that YAGNI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll check it out.


&gt;<i> &gt; What about plain text - any view on that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, in our API, it turned out that the things we wanted to send back
</I>&gt;<i> and forth were numbers, labels, lists and hashes.  Without exception.
</I>&gt;<i> JSON had everything we needed built-in and nothing we didn't need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think Atom is a bad thing for our use cases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure; I enumerated the things that I think would make Atom
</I>&gt;<i> attractive.  For our use cases in the Sun API, it didn't seem like a
</I>&gt;<i> terribly good match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I definitely want us all to be on the same wavelength whatever we end up
doing, but I also want to avoid closing doors unnecessarily (e.g. for
enterprise/private cloud deployments). Sun Cloud API does look particularly
good for public cloud (certainly better than the incumbent).

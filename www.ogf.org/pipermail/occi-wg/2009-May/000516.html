<PRE>Gary,

Thanks for this note.

My claim is that interoperability, if it describes data which IMO it
has to, must use a formalism to do so, and this means choosing or
making a format.  I prefer choosing over making.  While there can only
be one format/formalism for interop, there can be many for
integration.

You say &quot;A JSON only solution may alienate most of the world.&quot;  The
world will use OCCI directly or through an integration point.  OCCI
will not be &quot;X only&quot; at the integration points because it cannot be.
The question of &quot;how OCCI is adopted&quot; is one of integration.  The
whole point is to not impose one cloud implementation or format on
people at the cloud integration endpoint.

I am against interop formats being user-extensible because this WILL
break interop.  I am in favour of integration (&quot;rendering&quot;) formats
being user extensible.  (Sidenote: extending interop behaviour is
foreseeable but should be done by agreement and only after OCCI 1.0 is
defined.)

More later ... got to run.

</I>&gt;<i> Some general observations on this thread....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe anyone is asking to disregard your work, at least I hope
</I>&gt;<i> not. &#160;But what is happening here is a pitfall of starting with an light
</I>&gt;<i> model and an API without clear definition of requirements based on use
</I>&gt;<i> models.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets touch on some of the issues, at least from my perspective, sorry
</I>&gt;<i> for the terseness and directness, I'm very busy...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There are several public strategic use models emerging for clouds,
</I>&gt;<i> occurring out of control of this group. Many are still evolving
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Success of this effort, in part, is dependent on the ability to adopt
</I>&gt;<i> and integrate other well know and deployed standards and technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) An &#160;api is a REPRESENTATION of actions and data with implicate or
</I>&gt;<i> explicate organization into groups of interfaces. Actions, data and
</I>&gt;<i> organization will defined by the use models, or at least provide enough
</I>&gt;<i> that an api can be extrapolated from them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Any particular api &#160;can be RENDERED based on the native need of the
</I>&gt;<i> api consumer. We call them mappings. For example, you would not directly
</I>&gt;<i> use a PHP or javascript &#160;api in C/C++ program without translating it
</I>&gt;<i> into a form (a mapping) that the C/C++ compilers can accept and the
</I>&gt;<i> executing code can reach. C/C++ doesn't care about CDATA
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Many standards, specifications and technologies, deployed for
</I>&gt;<i> decades, are defined and implemented in XML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Entropy can occur though the lack of precision. ie: clearly defined
</I>&gt;<i> bounds. Ambiguity equals entropy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summarizing: The api represents a model, the rendered format of the api
</I>&gt;<i> will depend on the use model (including programming languages,
</I>&gt;<i> development tools chains and &#160;execution environments). We, meaning the
</I>&gt;<i> industry and the world, don't have well defined or detailed use model
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Opinions
</I>&gt;<i> Simple is better, but who cares if you can only interoperate with yourself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A JSON only solution may alienate &#160;most of the world. Although all the
</I>&gt;<i> consultants will have a field day with mapping, until the mapping have
</I>&gt;<i> to interoperate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The occi effort may and probably will support more than one api and
</I>&gt;<i> rendering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The occi NEEDS to develop profile based use cases. The profiles can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to set requirements and set priorities for mappings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trading off definition in the front of a processes for expedience
</I>&gt;<i> always results in exponential expenditures as you continue down the path
</I>&gt;<i> of deployments. JSON lacks definition &#160;and increases ambiguity. I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure what interop validation will look like, but the bounds of JSON data
</I>&gt;<i> may require significantly &#160;more work and definition before validation
</I>&gt;<i> can be achieved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I have a requirement for binary defined data...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inclination to give this the comprehensive retort that it deserves at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For a start I know nothing about AMQP so I have nothing to say about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the AMQP assertions, but the XML and JSON assertions are patently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> false and bordering on FUD (XML having extensibility and validation

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to blame for WS-*? Sun Cloud API, currently a work in progress, has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proven something? Seriously, WTF?).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is absolutely no question from anyone that XML is up to the task
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Google have already proven it on a large scale) but significant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerns about whether JSON is - concerns that remain unanswered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> despite my repeated requests for answers and concerns that this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal seeks to postpone or avoid entirely, thus making them someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else's problem. While most APIs currently support multiple formats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (even GData offer a JSON option for convenience if not interop) I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet to find a single successful JSON-only API so this all sounds a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too experimental for my liking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, given that things that are trivial with XML (transforms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embedding, signatures, encryption, etc.) are currently impossible with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JSON, this is the mother of all externalisations (that is, leaving our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users up the creek without a paddle when we are in the best position
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to solve the problem by making practical choices). It's also a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappointing attempt to foist personal preferences on others when we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can trivially cater for the entire spectrum of needs using XML &amp; XSLT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (work which I have alread done and demonstrated I might add - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absence of any volunteers to reinvent the wheel given I'm not about to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is also disconcerting). Other difficult questions like the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serialisation and serious performance problems of using hrefs (1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request for XML vs 1+n for JSON) have also been conveniently ignored
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus far and the best answer I've got about the absence of embedding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality in JSON is that as XML isn't perfect we're better off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with nothing?!?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most critically though, by telling SNIA, Google and pretty much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone else in the cloud standard space that they can go fornicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves, and in doing so missing the [only] opportunity to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standardise a well proven, risk-free, extensible protocol on which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others can safely build, I think we may well be witnessing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inception of CC-* (that is, WS-*, JSON edition). More specifically, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we slam the door on the possibility of others building on our efforts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then they will have little choice but to blaze their own trail,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forcing clients to support a myriad standards (OCCI for trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> management tasks, OVF for compute resources, SNIA's stuff for storage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and possibly networking, etc.).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I for one have negative interest in supporting something that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe could do more damage than good and knowing what happened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously, learning from our mistakes and practicing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the precautionary principle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle</A>&gt; would be well

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pwn the process is successful then those who witnessed the CCIF goat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rodeo well know that I have no problems saying it how I see it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I would suggest is that those who want to see JSON adopted get to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; interop first, with one format, is good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As you said, our first goal is to be functionally complete and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; thinking of the implications and had the question whether we plan to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; chuck OVF through our APIs? I think, we can take a position like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; html -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; i.e. use href mechanism as far as possible and base64 for the rest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; e) &#160; &#160; &#160;OGF-25 Presentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most probably we will not get to agreement on all the important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; points by OGF-25. We don't have to. At GGF-25, we present the state of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; our work - demark what we have agreed upon, and the alternatives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; working on. And until 1.0, things will be unstable anyway. Plus we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; honestly represent the different camps and seek insights from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; crowd.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; So I do not think GGF-25 is in critical path in anyway.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; as Alexis' points out, the minimal scope vs. maximum coverage is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; key. We can restrict or curtail the APIs to a minimum set -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; without any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; reduction in functionality; for example use hrefs instead of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Thanks for a thought-provoking week of emails on the OCCI-WG list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Especially thanks to Sam, Richard, Ben and Tim for laying out a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |the issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |One link that I found useful was this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |<A HREF="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud</A> where we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |find the following statement:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |---
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |if Cloud technology is going to take off, there'll have to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |competitive ecosystem; so that when you bet on a service provider, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |the relationship doesn't work out there's a way to take your business
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |to another provider with relatively little operational pain. Put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |another way: no lock-in. &#160;... I got all excited about this back in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |January at that Cloud Interop session. Anant Jhingran, an IBM VIP,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |spoke up and said &quot;Customers don't want interoperability, they want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |integration.&quot; ... &#160;&quot;Bzzzzzzzzzt! Wrong!&quot; I thought. But then I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |realized he was only half wrong; anyone going down this road needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |integration and interoperability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |---
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |What we have been discussing is &quot;for customers&quot;. &#160;So it is about both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |of these things:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Interoperability (&quot;interop&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Integration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |This made me realise that our OCCI discussions have correctly been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |about both issues. &#160;But, incorrectly, we have been commingling the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |two. &#160;For example a person will say &quot;you need X for interop&quot; and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |reply will be &quot;but you need Y&quot; when in fact Y is for integration.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |vice versa.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |This is a problem for us because it leads to confusion. &#160;But it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |symptom of a larger problem which is that interop and integration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |opposite requirements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Interop is about reducing the entropy in a general purpose system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |down to some level of behavioural invariance. &#160;This minimises the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; cost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |of meeting the defined behaviour correctly, and minimises the risk of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |different behaviours breaking interop. &#160;This is in turn about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; having a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |defined behaviour (in some format) and minimising its scope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Integration is about minimising the frictions between (a) the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |general purpose system and (b) any specific purpose external system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |that may be coupled to it. &#160;It is also, often, about maximising the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |number of specific systems (or &quot;features&quot;) that may be connected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Since we don't know ex ante what those are, this tends to maximise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |scope (eg &quot;feature creep&quot;). &#160;Too much specificity is the same as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |complexity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Because interop requires minimal scope, and integration pushes for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |maximal scope, they are in tension.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |They are BOTH about simplicity. &#160;Simplicity cannot be invoked on its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |own, as a reason for preferring interop over integration:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Interop is about simplicity of definition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Integration is about simplicity of end use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |BUT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Interop simplicity is ex ante
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Integration simplicity is ex post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |We cannot predict all ex post issues, but we can try and make simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |definitions ex ante. &#160;I argue below this means we have to have ONE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |definition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |So let's look at interop first:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |It's really important that interop be based on defined behaviour. &#160;Or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |it cannot be verified. &#160;Lack of verifiability is almost always a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |symptom that something is opaque, complex and ambiguous, which will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |break interop in subtle ways that cannot be seen in advance (due to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |the opacity). &#160;This later leads to brittleness when interop and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |integration are attempted in practice; and that leads to expensive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |patching at all levels, ... which is one thing that WS-* exhibits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |NOTE 1 on WS-* ---- IMO this was not accidental, and due to focussing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |on solving integration before solving interop. &#160;IIRC, the first WS-*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |was an Interop committee to fix minor vendor mismatches and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; versioning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |issues in prior WS protocols such as WSDL and SOAP. &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; formalisms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |WSDL and SOAP were not precise enough to spot these issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; upfront, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |they were left until it was too late.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Now let's look at the implications of having a definition of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; behaviour:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |You cannot define a system using multiple definitions. &#160;You have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |have one definition, preferably in a formalism that admits of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |automatic conformance testing. &#160;In the case of data formats, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |leads us to three possible choices:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |1) We remove data formats from the interop profile. &#160;They are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |of interop. &#160;Data interop is excluded. &#160;Data payloads are opaque
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |blobs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |OR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |2) We have one data format that can be defined unambiguously.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |OR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |3) We have multiple formats and derive them from a single unambiguous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |definition using canonical, verifiable, automatable, mappings. &#160;This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |definition can either be in a new format which we invent (option 3a)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |or it can be in an existing format (option 3b).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |I am going to rule out option (3a) on grounds of time and due to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |prevalence of existing candidates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Also, I think choice (1) is a complete cop-out -- I don't see how we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |can claim 'useful' interop without data interop. &#160;This leaves options
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |(2) and (3b). &#160;BOTH of these options require one format.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |By occam's razor, option 2 is preferable on grounds of simplicity -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |option (3b) does not add anything except one mapping for every extra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |format that is based on the core definition. &#160;Such complexity MUST be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |deferred as long as possible, and MAY be pushed into integration use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |cases. &#160;The latter is preferable. &#160;Complexity MAY be added later if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |necessary and then, reluctantly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |As a general observation if you have complexity (entropy) in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |it is very hard to take out. &#160;It may permeate the system at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |levels. &#160;Removal of the complexity is known as 'complete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; refactoring'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; | This is a bad outcome. &#160;Even worse is when refactoring cannot be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |for commercial reasons, eg because the systems are in production.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Then the complexity must be encapsulated and hidden. &#160;Attempts to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; wrap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |complex behaviours in simpler packaging usually fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |NOTE 2 on WS-* ---- This tried to do too much and ended up trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |wrap the complexity in simple packaging. &#160;This usually fails to work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |as we have seen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Another general observation:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Integration requires interop, ie. the use of a common general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |interop model; otherwise it is piecemeal and pointless. &#160;Example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |old 'integration brokers' that had N*N connections to maintain, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |which got replaced by N connections to a common system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* But you can have interop without integration - it just means 'you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |have a smaller audience'. &#160;This is fine because you can always grow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |your audience by integrating more case with the interoperating core.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |It is easier to do that when the interoperating core is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |programmatically simple (as in low entropy, small code blocks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; easy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |test conformance to the definition).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |I would like to add some observations from the world of AMQP...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |AMQP-1) It is a protocol with one simple common data format - it gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |that right. &#160;We leave it to integration products and services to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |support data formats at the edge (eg &quot;ESBs&quot;). &#160;OCCI should not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |an ESB - that is for products and services in the integration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |business.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |AMQP-2) That AMQP data format is not XML - see below for more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; thoughts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |on that. &#160;XML can be carried as an attached payload (just as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |in the JSON case btw).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |AMQP-3) The 0-8 and 0-9 specs took 18 months of production use to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; show
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |up the many very tiny interop bugs. &#160;We used those to create 0-9-1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |which does have interop (we have tested this) and is only 40 pages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |long. &#160;This would not have been possible with a complex spec. &#160;It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |would not have been possible with multiple data formats.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |AMQP-4) The 0-10 spec was focussed on supporting a lot of use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; cases eg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |&quot;integrate with multiple transport formats including SCTP and TCP and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |UDP&quot; and adding lots of features at all levels (eg JMS, support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |hardware, ..). &#160;That spec is really complicated and nearly 300 pages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |long. &#160;Some great new ideas are in it, but it's long and in my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |opinion not supportive of two interoperating implementations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |AMQP-5) All these painful lessons have taken the AMQP working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; group to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |a much happier place with AMQP 1.0 which tries to simplify everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |by taking stuff out that is not needed for interop, plus refactoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |(see above my comments on how removing entropy is hard) and clean-up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |All of the above has taken time because we did not learn from WS-*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |We did too much too fast and confused interop with integration. &#160;We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |are back on track now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Now to the issue of data formats. &#160;I have already argued that FOR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |INTEROP, there must be one definition. &#160;I argued that the best way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |do this is via a suitable single format. &#160;We can support as many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |recommended ways as we like FOR INTEGRATION ... and they can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |evolved over time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Here is my 2c on XML.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |XML-1) XML lets you do too much - because of namespaces and xsd it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |in effect multiple formats. &#160;This is bad - we want a single,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; testable,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |constrained definition for data interop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |XML-2) To enforce compliance with a simple XML definition, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |have an extra definition of a well formed 'small' document. &#160;But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |creating a new definition of a data format in XML is equivalent to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |defining a new data format, the same as 'option 3a' above. &#160;But that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |option was ruled out above, on grounds of time constraint.. provided
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |that a suitable alternative exists already (see JSON claims below).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |NOTE 3 on WS-* ---- IMHO a third reason why WS-* failed to be simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |enough to get happy, quick and wide adoption, is that (XML-1) issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |left too much data integration in the hands of customers, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |vendors could not produce useful products when XML could be all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |to all people. &#160;By not delivering on data integration, it became hard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |to deliver on the promise of integration at all. &#160;And recall that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |lowering integration costs was the selling point...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |So let's get INTEROP right and then do INTEGRATION.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Interop requires:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Model - yes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Data format - one definition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |* Metadata - ? tbd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |As an aside - I think that GData is the nuts but it is also really an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |*integration techonology*.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |Now, here are some claims about JSON:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |JSON-1) Sun have demonstrated that it is plausible as a data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; model for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |a cloud API. &#160;That makes it plausible for us to ask: can it be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; used as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |the core definition for interop?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |JSON-2) It is lower entropy than XML. &#160;This makes it easy to test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |conformance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |JSON-3) This means we do things the right way round -- simpler 'ex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |ante' choices make it EASIER for us to extend and enhance the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |on a by need basis. &#160;For example carrying OVF payloads, or other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |integration points. &#160;Many will be done by users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |So my recommendation is that the best way to avoid WS-* outcomes is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |A) Use one format for interop. &#160;Do interop first. &#160;Integration later.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |B) *At least for now* and *during the working draft* stage, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; use JSON
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |C) Other formats, for now, are &quot;integration&quot;. &#160;But we do interop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |OK.... I have to run off. &#160;I wrote this down in one go and don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |time to review it. &#160;Apologies for any mistakes in the presentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; |What do you all think?

That is correct.

To all ----

The conversation on the list is good but nothing should be deemed
obvious unless it is in a form that makes it so.  PLEASE use the wiki
to articulate specific proposals, in a form where they can be
commented on (on the list) and improved (on the wiki).



&gt;<i> It has been said many times this past month, but certainly the very first
</I>&gt;<i> goal of OCCI should be to settle on something totally trivial that can be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, and then produce a few implementations that do that. &#160;From my
</I>&gt;<i> perspective the absolute most trivial thing would be to instantiate a
</I>&gt;<i> virtual host, get a handle to it, and then destroy it. &#160;It sounds like this
</I>&gt;<i> has already been done, but as someone has suggested, capturing this in a use
</I>&gt;<i> case, describing how OCCI specifies such a scenario, then pointing to some
</I>&gt;<i> implementations which actually do it would be a great first step. &#160;Assuming
</I>&gt;<i> such a trivial process would be uninteresting and pointless is forgetting
</I>&gt;<i> the problem with assumptions. &#160;Has this been done? &#160;If so, highlight it on
</I>&gt;<i> the OCCI website landing page. &#160;If not, get it done.
</I>
This is an excellent statement of the difference between list and
wiki.  It should not be necessary to ask a question on the list, to
get an answer about something that has already been either (a) agreed,
or (b) proposed clearly.



&gt;&gt;<i> Because we want to make use of prior art, at this point I am going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quote Andy's email from earlier today: &quot;If we want to take the middle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ground yet not sit on the fence it would be a useful exercise to see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what [ GoGrid ] and [ Sun ] offer and do not offer? See where our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts here could improve these published APIs and models?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've probably missed something. &#160;Why aren't you including EC2?
</I>
EC2 is there in the matrix of existing APIs as a reference point and
it is legitimate to say &quot;wait but EC2 has this functionality and OCCI
does not, so what requirement does EC2 meet (if any) that OCCI needs
to meet&quot;.

The notion of taking API X as a 'starting point' is based on it being:

* open (licensing)
* concrete (unambiguous, discussable, implementable)
* modifiable (a licensing issue)
* extensible (eg to add functionality or integration points)

Sun and GG (and EH) meet those criteria.  Given the Sun documents we
could take the GG and EH work and &quot;make something better&quot;.  We could
also take the OCCI work and make something better still.

This process works when multiple users and implementers support it.
That's what I am looking for.  The keyword is multiple.  Anything else
is just hot air.

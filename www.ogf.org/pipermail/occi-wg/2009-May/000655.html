<PRE>
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am not feeling comfortable with having a state model which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; will change on the fly, depending what a resource will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; answer.  For one thing, it will make user interfaces and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; tools really difficult to design:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - should I add a suspend button, even if it works only sometimes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - if it worked once, will it work again?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - what can I do if it does not work?  I want to suspend,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    dammit! ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't share your pessimism, but then again, I also think we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting our wires crossed. I think there is a lot of help here from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hateoas which does a lot to address your concerns above (??)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That was exactly the point of introducing both together - given  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that most of the innovation is going to happen server side, clients  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be as dumb as possible. That is, it doesn't matter if a new  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state comes along after a client has shipped because it will be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advertised as a potential transition (HATEOAS), perhaps even with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the expected target state.
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great. Anyone doesn't agree with the need for [and proposed solution  
</I>&gt;<i> offering] flexibility in the state model?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The temptation is to assume that infrastructure is a simple problem  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a fixed domain but I can assure you this not the case -  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without allowing for such flexibility each implementor will find  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves having a good chance of running into functions they are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not able to expose via the API, or which the API expects but which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not present (for example, if &quot;stop&quot; implicitly results in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;destroy&quot; should we offer &quot;stop&quot; at all?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My point was I wanted to talk about the &quot;states as verbs&quot; model  
</I>&gt;<i> which currently on the wiki ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the question is do you ask a &quot;RUNNING&quot; resource to &quot;STOP&quot; by  
</I>&gt;<i> pressing a button in order to get it to the &quot;STOPPED&quot; state or do  
</I>&gt;<i> you update its status from &quot;RUNNING&quot; to &quot;STOPPED&quot;. To me the latter  
</I>&gt;<i> is unclean because who are you to say you're going to get to that  
</I>&gt;<i> state immediately, or indeed that you'll even get there at all -  
</I>&gt;<i> updating the status of a &quot;STOPPED&quot; machine to &quot;RUNNING&quot; makes no  
</I>&gt;<i> sense if there's an operating system error that causes the boot to  
</I>&gt;<i> fail for example. I certainly prefer pressing a &quot;START&quot; button,  
</I>&gt;<i> having a transitional &quot;STARTING&quot; state with an accurate progress  
</I>&gt;<i> indicator and eventually reaching a &quot;RUNNING&quot; state. There's some  
</I>&gt;<i> sense in a parametrised &quot;transition-to&quot; function of some sort with  
</I>&gt;<i> an array of potential target states but I still think I prefer the  
</I>&gt;<i> actuator approach that we currently have.

Hi Sam,

My thoughts on both your post and that of Chris too. I hope I'm  
reading your email correctly.

I like posting to a collection, because it does give an obvious holder  
for the state collection, which is then my state history, should i  
need it. I can also publish a membership policy (which changes) of  
what 'types' of new resources can go into a collection. This is useful  
to build the payload. It is also a record of failed transitions.

I don't think this ignores the possibility of a delay or failure in  
state change. After POSTing to the collection, returning a 202, means  
that is has been accepted for processing (if i understand correctly).  
So, there is an (implied) &quot;in-process&quot; sub-state. And the accepted-for- 
processing resource is then a good one to ask why it went wrong, if  
something did go wrong ... (?) That's something I don't see in the  
actuator approach (again I might be missing something) as I don't see  
that it is creating new resources.

Roger

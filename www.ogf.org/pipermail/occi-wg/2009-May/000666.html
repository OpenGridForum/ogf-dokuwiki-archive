&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me, the largest gap in the nouns, verbs and attributes is with regards
</I>&gt;<i> to networks. Here are some thoughts on capabilities which I believe we need
</I>&gt;<i> and options to implement these - feedback please!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good work so far, thanks.


&gt;<i> Basics
</I>&gt;<i> ------
</I>&gt;<i> Networks will be a top level noun, along with servers and storage. Users
</I>&gt;<i> will link a server to a network to specify that the server is attached to
</I>&gt;<i> that network. There will be one special network presenting the public
</I>&gt;<i> internet, and users can create additional private networks for themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Networks and storage can attach to networks remember. +1 for generic links.

Internet could be a well known UUID, but may be better not to specify as
there are different &quot;types&quot; of internet (fast, slow, filtered, unfiltered,
etc.). I know this was something I suggested myself but i'm not sure it
pulls its weight... maybe it does... at least it should be optional (think
offline setups).


&gt;<i> The open questions are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Public static IPs
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> On all public clouds, customers can purchase static IPs (e.g. Amazon
</I>&gt;<i> Elastic
</I>&gt;<i> IP) for uses where a constant server location is helpful (e.g. typical web
</I>&gt;<i> hosting).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll need a means for customers to create, list and destroy the public
</I>&gt;<i> static IPs which they own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two options:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Public static IPs are first-class nouns
</I>&gt;<i> b) They are listed inside the public internet network
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd favour a), which is the case with most public clouds today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok be sure to include IPv6 addresses though. Oh, and IPX/SPX since we've got
an old novell server. And appletalk... you get the point. While we're there
I guess we should make storage LUNs first class citizens too. How about
compute peripherals?

Obviously I'm joking - IPs belong to networks and thus should hang off
networks. Need a &quot;type&quot; attribute for ipv4, ipv6, ipx/spx, etc.

Active networks
&gt;<i> ---------------
</I>&gt;<i> At its most basic, a network should behave like a plain ethernet switch -
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> provides no services at all, and simply connects all the servers which
</I>&gt;<i> attach to it. Servers are free to chose their own IP addresses, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of active services which are possible on a network:
</I>&gt;<i> - Central DHCP server
</I>&gt;<i> - Bridge to a physical VLAN (e.g. containing physical dedicated servers in
</I>&gt;<i>  colocation with the cloud provider)
</I>&gt;<i> - Load balancer between several web servers on a private network across to
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i>  single IP on the public internet.
</I>&gt;<i> - etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) The network object itself can optionally provide these. They are
</I>&gt;<i>   configured using attributes and verbs on the network.
</I>&gt;<i> b) There are separate 'appliance' objects which provide these services, and
</I>&gt;<i>   are linked onto the network just as a server would be (e.g. a 'DHCP
</I>&gt;<i>   server' appliance and or 'load balancer' appliance).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) feels lighter-weight, but I suspect b) is more powerful. As such the
</I>&gt;<i> choice depends on how far OCCI wants to go down this route.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm happy with a combination... it makes sense to set &quot;dhcp: true&quot; on a
network segment but it makes more sense to configure an advanced application
level firewall (like a Netscaler
VPX&lt;<A HREF="http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/feature.asp?contentID=1689968">http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/feature.asp?contentID=1689968</A>&gt;)
as a compute resource. Bonus points for being able to supply the device
configuration via OCCI (*cough*XML*cough*). Firewall rules should probably
be associated with a specific network connection, which may be non-trivial
but increasingly relevant/important (devices should have no access by
default when introduced and anything from pinholes to application level
firewalls applied thereafter).


&gt;<i> Linking to a network
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, there are a few attributes which can specified on the link when a
</I>&gt;<i> server is linked to a network:
</I>&gt;<i> - The physical interface on the server (nic:0, nic:1, etc.)
</I>

Definitely, but this should make sense for the device - your eth0 is my en0
is his &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; and for network devices you have stuff like
&quot;1/1&quot;. We don't care - add it as an attribute and forget about it.


&gt;<i> - Port firewalling rules (e.g. connect server to the internet network, but
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i>  allow port 80 inbound)
</I>

We don't need to specify it, but we should consider it something someone
will have to implement in due course.


&gt;<i> - IP firewalling rules (e.g. connect server to the private network, and
</I>&gt;<i>  allow it to communicate on 192.168.0.0-23 but no others)
</I>

Ditto. This configuration could be arbitrarily complex (specifying HTTP
verbs, URL regexps, etc.) and is probably device dependent at least until
standardised. Yet another place where embedding/linking arbitrary content
types will be required.


&gt;<i> - Local DHCP (e.g. the server operating system is internally configured
</I>&gt;<i>  to DHCP. I am connecting it to the public internet, and want it to appear
</I>&gt;<i>  with my assigned public static IP. Please send a DHCP response with that
</I>&gt;<i>  specific IP address).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm... sounds unnecessary. Once you've assigned an IP to a server if you
want to make life easier by offering it over DHCP then go right ahead... I
don't see the use case otherwise.


&gt;<i> I think that all of these are best implemented as attributes on the link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup, and more.

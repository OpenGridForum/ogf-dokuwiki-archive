<PRE>Here's another insightful reply from William Vambenepe:

Speaking of WS-*, I don't think it's a selfish plug for me to point you
&gt;<i> towards the post in which I examine how previous efforts (mainly around
</I>&gt;<i> WS-*) can inform Cloud standards going forward. It is very relevant to what
</I>&gt;<i> you write here. When I read this paragraph:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Enter the OGF's Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) whose (initial) goal
</I>&gt;<i> it is to provide an extensible interface to Cloud Infrastructure Services
</I>&gt;<i> (IaaS). To do so it needs to allow clients to enumerate and manipulate an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary number of server side &quot;resources&quot; (from one to many millions) all
</I>&gt;<i> via a single entry point. These compute, network and storage resources need
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to be created, retrieved, updated and deleted (CRUD) and links
</I>&gt;<i> need to be able to be formed between them (e.g. virtual machines linking to
</I>&gt;<i> storage devices and network interfaces). It is also necessary to manage
</I>&gt;<i> state (start, stop, restart) and retrieve performance and billing
</I>&gt;<i> information, among other things.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... I am a bit worried because you describe the whole field of IT modeling
</I>&gt;<i> and interoperability as we've tried to capture it for the last decade. So
</I>&gt;<i> when I see that you plan to &quot;deliver an implementable draft this month&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> get a little worried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, here is the &quot;lessons to learn&quot; post, titled &quot;A post-mortem on the
</I>&gt;<i> previous IT management revolution&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/700Among">http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/700Among</A> other things, beware on
</I>&gt;<i> focusing on protocols rather than models, beware of working without clear
</I>&gt;<i> use cases and beware of trying to address broad problems rather than
</I>&gt;<i> constrained problems. BTW, I am not saying that you are doing these things
</I>&gt;<i> and I haven't looked at the working documents on the OCCI site. These are
</I>&gt;<i> just thoughts that come to mind from reading this blog entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And his blog post:

A post-mortem on the previous IT management
revolution&lt;<A HREF="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/700">http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/700</A>&gt; by
&gt;<i> William Vambenepe
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before rushing to standardize &#8220;Cloud APIs&#8221;, let&#8217;s take a look back at the
</I>&gt;<i> previous attempt to tackle the same problem, which is one of IT management
</I>&gt;<i> integration and automation. I am referring to the definition of
</I>&gt;<i> specifications that attempted to use the then-emerging SOAP-based Web
</I>&gt;<i> services framework to easily integrate IT management systems and their
</I>&gt;<i> targets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Leaving aside the &#8220;Cloud&#8221; spin of today and the &#8220;Web services&#8221; frenzy of
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday, the underlying problem remains to provide IT services (mostly
</I>&gt;<i> applications) in a way that offers the best balance of performance,
</I>&gt;<i> availability, security and economy. Concretely, it is about being able to
</I>&gt;<i> deploy whatever IT infrastructure and application bits need to be deployed,
</I>&gt;<i> configure them and take any required ongoing action (patch, update, scale
</I>&gt;<i> up/down, optimize&#8230;) to keep them humming so customers don&#8217;t notice anything
</I>&gt;<i> bothersome and you don&#8217;t break any regulation. Or rather so that any
</I>&gt;<i> disruption a customer sees and any mandate you violate cost you less than it
</I>&gt;<i> would have cost to avoid them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The realization that IT systems are moving more and more towards
</I>&gt;<i> distributed/connected applications was the primary reason that pushed us
</I>&gt;<i> towards the definition of Web services protocols geared towards management
</I>&gt;<i> interactions. By providing a uniform and network-friendly interface, we
</I>&gt;<i> hoped to make it convenient to integrate management tasks vertically
</I>&gt;<i> (between layers of the IT stack) and horizontally (across distributed
</I>&gt;<i> applications). The latter is why we focused so much on managing new entities
</I>&gt;<i> such as Web services, their execution environments and their conversations.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ll refer you to the WSMF submission&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-07-21-a.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-07-21-a.html</A>&gt;that my HP colleagues and I made to OASIS in 2003 for the first consistent
</I>&gt;<i> definition of such a management framework. The overview white paper&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.coverpages.org/WSMF-Overview.pdf">http://xml.coverpages.org/WSMF-Overview.pdf</A>&gt;even has a use case called &#8220;management as a service&#8221; if you&#8217;re still not
</I>&gt;<i> convinced of the alignment with today&#8217;s Cloud-talk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there are some differences between Web service management
</I>&gt;<i> protocols and Cloud APIs. Virtualization capabilities are more advanced than
</I>&gt;<i> when the WS effort started. The prospect of using hosted resources is more
</I>&gt;<i> realistic (though still unproven as a mainstream business practice). Open
</I>&gt;<i> source component are expected to play a larger role. But none of these
</I>&gt;<i> considerations fundamentally changes the task at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let&#8217;s start with a quick round-up and update on the most relevant efforts
</I>&gt;<i> and their status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Protocols*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WSMF &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-07-21-a.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2003-07-21-a.html</A>&gt; (Web Services
</I>&gt;<i> Management Framework): an HP-created set of specifications, submitted to the
</I>&gt;<i> OASIS WSDM working group (see below). Was subsumed into WSDM. Not only a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol BTW, it includes a basic model for Web services-related artifacts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Manageability&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-manage/">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specification/ws-manage/</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> An IBM-led alternative to parts of WSDM, also submitted to OASIS WSDM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WSDM &lt;<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsdm">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsdm</A>&gt;(Web Services Distributed Management): An OASIS technical committee.
</I>&gt;<i> Produced two standards (a protocol, &#8220;Management Using Web Services&#8221; and a
</I>&gt;<i> model of Web services, &#8220;Management Of Web Services&#8221;). Makes use of WSRF (see
</I>&gt;<i> below). Saw a few implementations but never achieved real adoption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OGSI &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ggf.org/documents/GFD.15.pdf">http://www.ggf.org/documents/GFD.15.pdf</A>&gt; (Open Grid Services
</I>&gt;<i> Infrastructure): A GGF (the organization now known as OGF) standard to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a service-oriented resource manipulation infrastructure for Grid
</I>&gt;<i> computing. Replaced with WSRF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WSRF &lt;<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrf">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrf</A>&gt;: An
</I>&gt;<i> OASIS technical committee which produced several standards (the main one is
</I>&gt;<i> WS-ResourceProperties). Started as an attempt to align the GGF/OGSI approach
</I>&gt;<i> to resource access with the IT management approach (represented by WSDM).
</I>&gt;<i> Saw some adoption and is currently quietly in use under the cover in the
</I>&gt;<i> GGF/OGF space. Basically replaced OGSI but didn&#8217;t make it in the IT
</I>&gt;<i> management world because its vehicle there, WSDM, didn&#8217;t.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Management &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wsman</A>&gt;: A DMTF standard,
</I>&gt;<i> based on a Microsoft-led submission. Similar to WSDM in many ways. Won the
</I>&gt;<i> adoption battle with it. Based on WS-Transfer and WS-Enumeration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WS-ResourceTransfer&lt;<A HREF="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/08/resourceTransfer/WS-ResourceTransfer.pdf">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/08/resourceTransfer/WS-ResourceTransfer.pdf</A>&gt;(aka WS-RT): An attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> reconcile &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.coverpages.org/WSM-HarmonizationRoadmap200603.pdf">http://xml.coverpages.org/WSM-HarmonizationRoadmap200603.pdf</A>&gt;the underlying foundations of WSDM and WS-Management. Stalled as a private
</I>&gt;<i> effort (IBM, Microsoft, HP, Intel). Was later submitted to the W3C WS-RA
</I>&gt;<i> working group (see below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WSRA &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/ra/">http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/ra/</A>&gt; (Web Services Resource Access): A W3C
</I>&gt;<i> working group created to standardize the specifications that WS-Management
</I>&gt;<i> is built on (WS-Transfer etc) and to add features to them in the form of
</I>&gt;<i> WS-RT (which was also submitted there, in order to be finalized). This is
</I>&gt;<i> (presumably) the last attempt at standardizing a SOAP-based access framework
</I>&gt;<i> for distributed resources. Whether the window of opportunity to do so is
</I>&gt;<i> still open is unclear. Work is ongoing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WS-ResourceCatalog&lt;<A HREF="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2007/05/ResourceCatalog/WS-ResourceCatalog.pdf">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2007/05/ResourceCatalog/WS-ResourceCatalog.pdf</A>&gt;: A discovery helper companion specification to WS-Management. Started as a
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft document, went through the &#8220;WSDM/WS-Management reconciliation&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> effort, emerged as a new specification that was submitted to DMTF&lt;<A HREF="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/110">http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/110</A>&gt;in May 2007. Not heard of since.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CMDBf&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0252_1.0.0c.pdf">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0252_1.0.0c.pdf</A>&gt;(Configuration Management Database Federation): A DMTF working group (and
</I>&gt;<i> soon to be standard) that mainly defines a SOAP-based protocol to query
</I>&gt;<i> repositories of configuration information. Not linked with (or dependent on)
</I>&gt;<i> any of the specifications listed above (it is debatable whether it belongs
</I>&gt;<i> in this list or is part of a new breed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Modeling*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DCML &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dcml.org/">http://www.dcml.org/</A>&gt; (Data Center Markup Language): The first
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive effort to model key elements of a data center, their
</I>&gt;<i> relationships and their policies. Led by EDS and Opsware. Never managed to
</I>&gt;<i> attract the major management vendors. Transitioned to an OASIS member
</I>&gt;<i> section and died of being ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SDM &lt;<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181772(VS.80).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181772%28VS.80%29.aspx</A>&gt;(System Definition Model): A Microsoft specification to model an IT system
</I>&gt;<i> in a way that includes constraints and validation, with the goal of
</I>&gt;<i> improving automation and better linking the different phases of the
</I>&gt;<i> application lifecycle. Was the starting point for SML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SML &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/SML/">http://www.w3.org/XML/SML/</A>&gt; (Service Modeling Language): Currently a
</I>&gt;<i> W3C &#8220;proposed recommendation&#8221; (soon to be a recommendation, I assume) with
</I>&gt;<i> the same goals as SDM. It was created, starting from SDM, by a consortium of
</I>&gt;<i> companies that eventually submitted it&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2007/01/">http://www.w3.org/Submission/2007/01/</A>&gt;to W3C. No known adoption other than the Eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> COSMOS &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/cosmos/resource_modeling/index.php">http://www.eclipse.org/cosmos/resource_modeling/index.php</A>&gt; project
</I>&gt;<i> (Microsoft was supposed to use it, but there hasn&#8217;t been any news on that
</I>&gt;<i> front for a while). Technically, it is a combination of XSD and Schematron.
</I>&gt;<i> It appears dead, unless it turns out that Microsoft is indeed using it (I
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t know whether System Center is still using SDM, whether they are
</I>&gt;<i> adopting SML, whether they are moving towards M or whether they have given
</I>&gt;<i> up on the model-centric vision).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CML (Common Model Library): An effort by the SML authors to create a set of
</I>&gt;<i> model elements using the SML metamodel. Appears to be dead (no news in a
</I>&gt;<i> long time and the cml-project.org domain name that was used seems
</I>&gt;<i> abandoned).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SDD &lt;<A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sdd">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sdd</A>&gt;(Solution Deployment Descriptor): An OASIS standard to define a packaging
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism meant to simplify the deployment and configuration of software
</I>&gt;<i> units. It is to an application archive what OVF is to a virtual disk. Little
</I>&gt;<i> adoption that I know of, but maybe I have a blind spot on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OVF &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0243_1.0.0.pdf">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0243_1.0.0.pdf</A>&gt;(Open Virtualization Format): A recently
</I>&gt;<i> released &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.coverpages.org/DMTF-OVFv10-Standard.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/DMTF-OVFv10-Standard.html</A>&gt; DMTF
</I>&gt;<i> standard. Defines a packaging and descriptor format to distribute virtual
</I>&gt;<i> machines. It does not defined a common virtual machine format, but a wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> around it. Seems to have some momentum. Like CMDBf, it may be best thought
</I>&gt;<i> of as part of a new breed than directly associated with WS-Management and
</I>&gt;<i> friends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not an exhaustive list. I have left aside the eventing aspects
</I>&gt;<i> (WS-Notification, WS-Eventing, WS-EventNotification) because while relevant
</I>&gt;<i> it is larger discussion and this entry to too long already (see here&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.elementallinks.net/2008/09/epts-event-pr-3.html">http://blog.elementallinks.net/2008/09/epts-event-pr-3.html</A>&gt;and
</I>&gt;<i> here&lt;<A HREF="http://travisspencer.com/blog/2008/11/effort-to-converge-ws-eventing.html">http://travisspencer.com/blog/2008/11/effort-to-converge-ws-eventing.html</A>&gt;for some updates from late last year on the eventing front). It also does
</I>&gt;<i> not cover the Grid work (other than OGSI/WSRF to the extent that they
</I>&gt;<i> intersect with the IT management world), even though a lot of the work that
</I>&gt;<i> took place there is just as relevant to Cloud computing as the IT management
</I>&gt;<i> work listed above. Especially CDDLM/CDL&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ggf.org/documents/GFD.127.pdf">http://www.ggf.org/documents/GFD.127.pdf</A>&gt;an abandoned effort to port
</I>&gt;<i> SmartFrog &lt;<A HREF="http://smartfrog.org/">http://smartfrog.org/</A>&gt; to the then-hot XML standards, from
</I>&gt;<i> which there are plenty of relevant lessons to extract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The lessons*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does this inventory tell us that&#8217;s relevant to future Cloud API
</I>&gt;<i> standardization work? The first lesson is that protocols are easy and models
</I>&gt;<i> are hard. WS-Management and WSDM technically get the job done. CMDBf will be
</I>&gt;<i> a good query language. But none of the model-related efforts listed above
</I>&gt;<i> seem to have hit the mark of &#8220;doing the job&#8221;. With the possible exception of
</I>&gt;<i> OVF which is promising (though the current expectations on it&lt;<A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10216049-92.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10216049-92.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20</A>&gt;are often beyond
</I>&gt;<i> what it really delivers&lt;<A HREF="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2009/04/21/ovf-a-few-layers-short-of-a-full-stack.aspx">http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2009/04/21/ovf-a-few-layers-short-of-a-full-stack.aspx</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> In general, the more focused and narrow a modeling effort is, the more
</I>&gt;<i> successful it seems to be (with OVF as the most focused of the list and CML
</I>&gt;<i> as the other extreme). That&#8217;s lesson learned number two: models that
</I>&gt;<i> encompass a wide range of systems are attractive, but impossible to deliver.
</I>&gt;<i> Models that focus on a small sub-area are the way to go. The question is
</I>&gt;<i> whether these specialized models can at least share a common metamodel or
</I>&gt;<i> other base building blocks (a type system, a serialization, a relationship
</I>&gt;<i> model, a constraint mechanism, etc), which would make life easier for
</I>&gt;<i> orchestrators. SML tries (tried?) to be all that, with no luck. RDF could be
</I>&gt;<i> all that, but hasn&#8217;t managed to get noticed in this context. The OVF and SDD
</I>&gt;<i> examples seems to point out that the best we&#8217;ll get is XML as a shared
</I>&gt;<i> foundation (a type system and a serialization). At this point, I am ready to
</I>&gt;<i> throw the towel on achieving more modeling uniformity than XML provides, and
</I>&gt;<i> ready to do the needed transformations in code instead. At least until the
</I>&gt;<i> next window of opportunity arrives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish that rather than being 80% protocols and 20% models, the effort in
</I>&gt;<i> the WS-based wave of IT management standards had been the other way around.
</I>&gt;<i> So we&#8217;d have a bit more to show for our work, for example a clear, complete
</I>&gt;<i> and useful way to capture the operational configuration of application
</I>&gt;<i> delivery services (VPN, cache, SSL, compression, DoS protection&#8230;). Even if
</I>&gt;<i> the actual specification turns out to not make it, its content should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to inform its successor (in the same way that even if you don&#8217;t use CIM
</I>&gt;<i> to model your server it is interesting to see what attributes CIM has for a
</I>&gt;<i> server).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s less true with protocols. Either you use them (and they&#8217;re very
</I>&gt;<i> valuable) or you don&#8217;t (and they&#8217;re largely irrelevant). They don&#8217;t capture
</I>&gt;<i> domain knowledge that&#8217;s intrinsically valuable. What value does WSDM
</I>&gt;<i> provide, for example, now that&#8217;s it&#8217;s collecting dust? How much will the
</I>&gt;<i> experience inform its successor (other than trying to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Addressing disaster)? The trend today seems to be that a more direct use
</I>&gt;<i> of HTTP (&#8221;REST&#8221;) will replace these protocols. Sure. Fine. But anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> expects this break from the past to be a vaccination against past problems
</I>&gt;<i> is in for a nasty surprise. Because, and I am repeating myself, *it&#8217;s the
</I>&gt;<i> model, stupid*. Not the protocol. Something I (hopefully) explained in my
</I>&gt;<i> comments on the Sun Cloud API &lt;<A HREF="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/632">http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/632</A>&gt;(before I knew that caring about this API might actually become part of my
</I>&gt;<i> day job) and something on which I&#8217;ll come back in a future post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another lesson is the need for clear use cases. Yes, it feels silly to
</I>&gt;<i> utter such an obvious statement. But trust me, standards groups still
</I>&gt;<i> haven&#8217;t gotten this. It&#8217;s not until years spent on WSDM and then
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Management that I realized that most people were not going after
</I>&gt;<i> management integration, as I was, but rather manageability. Where
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;manageability&#8221; is concerned with discovering and monitoring individual
</I>&gt;<i> resources, while &#8220;management integration&#8221; is concerned with providing a
</I>&gt;<i> systematic view of the environment, with automation as the goal. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, manageability standards can allow you to get a traditional IT
</I>&gt;<i> management console without the need for agents. Management integration
</I>&gt;<i> standards can allow you to coordinate your management systems and automate
</I>&gt;<i> their orchestration. WS-Management is for manageability. CMDBf is in the
</I>&gt;<i> management integration category. Many of the (very respectful and civilized)
</I>&gt;<i> head-butting sessions I engaged in during the WSDM effort can be traced back
</I>&gt;<i> to the difference between these two sets of use cases. And there is plenty
</I>&gt;<i> of room for such disconnect in the so-loosely-defined &#8220;Cloud&#8221; world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have also learned (or re-learned) that arbitrary non-backward compatible
</I>&gt;<i> versioning, e.g. for political or procedural reasons as with WS-Addressing,
</I>&gt;<i> is a crime. XML namespaces (of the XSD and WSDL types, as well as URIs used
</I>&gt;<i> in similar ways in specifications, e.g. to identify a dialect or profile)
</I>&gt;<i> are tricky, because they don&#8217;t have backward compatibility metadata and
</I>&gt;<i> because of the practice to use organizations domain names in the URI (as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to specification-specific names that can be easily transferred, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> cmdbf.org versus dmtf.org/cmdbf). In the WS-based management world, we
</I>&gt;<i> inherited these problems at the protocol level from the generic WS stack.
</I>&gt;<i> Our hands are more or less clean, but only because we didn&#8217;t have enough
</I>&gt;<i> success/longevity to generate our own versioning problems, at the model
</I>&gt;<i> level. But those would have been there had these models been able to see the
</I>&gt;<i> light of day (CML) or see adoption (DCML).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also practical lessons that can be learned about the tactics and
</I>&gt;<i> strategies of the main players. Because it looks like they may not change
</I>&gt;<i> very much, as corporations or even as individuals. Karla Norsworthy speaks
</I>&gt;<i> for IBM on Cloud interoperability standards in this article&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sdtimes.com/CLOUD_PROVIDERS_VOW_INTEROPERABILITY/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING/33410">http://www.sdtimes.com/CLOUD_PROVIDERS_VOW_INTEROPERABILITY/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING/33410</A>&gt;.

Winston Bumpus
</I>&gt;<i> is driving the standards strategy at VMWare. These are all veterans of the
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Management, WSDM and related wars collaborations (and more generally
</I>&gt;<i> the whole WS-* effort for the first two). For the details of what there is
</I>&gt;<i> to learn from the past in that area, you&#8217;ll have to corner me in a hotel bar
</I>&gt;<i> and buy me a few drinks though. I am pretty sure you&#8217;d get your money&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> worth (I am not a heavy drinker)&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, here are my recommendations for standardizing Cloud API, based
</I>&gt;<i> on lessons from the Web services management effort. The theme is &#8220;focus on
</I>&gt;<i> domain models&#8221;. The line items:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Have clear goals for each effort. E.g. is your use case to deploy and
</I>&gt;<i>    run an existing application in a Cloud-like automated environment, or is it
</I>&gt;<i>    to create new applications that efficiently take advantage of the added
</I>&gt;<i>    flexibility. Very different problems.
</I>&gt;<i>    - If you want to use OVF, then beef it up to better apply to Cloud
</I>&gt;<i>    situations, but keep it focused on VM packaging: don&#8217;t try to grow it into
</I>&gt;<i>    the complete model for the entire data center (e.g. a new DCML).
</I>&gt;<i>    - Complement OVF with similar specifications for other domains, like
</I>&gt;<i>    the application delivery systems listed above. Informally try to keep these
</I>&gt;<i>    different specifications consistent, but don&#8217;t over-engineer it by repeating
</I>&gt;<i>    the SML attempt. It is more important to have each specification map well to
</I>&gt;<i>    its domain of application than it is to have perfect consistency between
</I>&gt;<i>    them. Discrepancies can be bridged in code, or in a later incarnation.
</I>&gt;<i>    - As you segment by domain, as suggested in the previous two bullets,
</I>&gt;<i>    don&#8217;t segment the models any further within each domain. Handle
</I>&gt;<i>    configuration, installation and monitoring issues as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Don&#8217;t sweat the protocols. HTTP, plain old SOAP (don&#8217;t call it POS)
</I>&gt;<i>    or WS-* will meet your need. Pick one. You don&#8217;t have a scalability
</I>&gt;<i>    challenge as much as you have a model challenge so don&#8217;t get distracted
</I>&gt;<i>    here. If you use REST, do it in the mindset that Tim Bray describes&lt;<A HREF="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/03/16/Sun-Cloud</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>    &#8220;*If you&#8217;re going to do bits-on-the-wire, Why not use HTTP?&lt;<A HREF="http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/why-http/">http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/why-http/</A>&gt;And if you&#8217;re going to use HTTP, use it right. That&#8217;s all.
</I>&gt;<i>    *&#8221; Not as something that needs to scale to Web scale or as a rebuff of
</I>&gt;<i>    WS-*.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Beware of versioning. Version for operational changes only, not
</I>&gt;<i>    organizational reasons. Provide metadata to assert and encourage backward
</I>&gt;<i>    compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a recipe for the ideal result but it is what I see as
</I>&gt;<i> practically achievable. And fault-tolerant, in the sense that the failure of
</I>&gt;<i> one piece would not negate the value of the others. As much as I have constrained
</I>&gt;<i> expectations &lt;<A HREF="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/684">http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/684</A>&gt; for Cloud
</I>&gt;<i> portability, I still want it to improve to the extent possible. If we can&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> get a consistent RDF-based (or RDF-like in many ways) modeling framework,
</I>&gt;<i> let&#8217;s at least apply ourselves to properly understanding and modeling the
</I>&gt;<i> important areas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to these general lessons, there remains the question of what
</I>&gt;<i> specific specifications will/should transition to the Cloud universe.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly not all of them, since not all of them even made it in the &#8220;regular&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> IT management world for which they were designed. How many then? Not
</I>&gt;<i> surprisingly (since IBM had a big role in most of them), Karla Norsworthy,
</I>&gt;<i> in the interview&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sdtimes.com/CLOUD_PROVIDERS_VOW_INTEROPERABILITY/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING/33410">http://www.sdtimes.com/CLOUD_PROVIDERS_VOW_INTEROPERABILITY/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING/33410</A>&gt;mentioned above, asserts that
</I>&gt;<i> *&#8220;infrastructure as a service, or virtualization as a paradigm for
</I>&gt;<i> deployment, is a situation where a lot of existing interoperability work
</I>&gt;<i> that the industry has done will surely work to allow integration of
</I>&gt;<i> services&#8221;*. And just as unsurprisingly Amazon&#8217;s Adam Selipsky, who&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> company has nothing to with the previous wave but finds itself in leadership
</I>&gt;<i> position WRT to Cloud Computing is a lot more circumspect: *&#8220;whether
</I>&gt;<i> existing standards can be transferred to this case [of cloud computing] or
</I>&gt;<i> if it&#8217;s a new topic is [too] early to say&#8221;*. OVF is an obvious candidate.
</I>&gt;<i> WS-Management is by far the most widely implemented of the bunch, so that
</I>&gt;<i> gives it an edge too (it is apparently already in use for Cloud monitoring,
</I>&gt;<i> according to this press release&lt;<A HREF="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200903/ai_n31400439/">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200903/ai_n31400439/</A>&gt;by an &#8220;innovation leader in automated network and systems monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> software&#8221; that I had never heard of). Then there is the question of what IBM
</I>&gt;<i> has in mind for WS-RT (and other specifications that the WS-RA working group
</I>&gt;<i> is toiling on). If it&#8217;s not used as part of a Cloud API then I really don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> know what it will be used for. But selling it as such is going to be an
</I>&gt;<i> uphill battle. CMDBf is a candidate too, as a model-neutral way to manage
</I>&gt;<i> the configuration of a distributed system. But here I am, violating two of
</I>&gt;<i> my own recommendations (&#8221;focus on models&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t isolate config from
</I>&gt;<i> other modeling aspects&#8221;). I guess it will take another pass to really learn&#8230;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Web is built on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> a client-server protocol that simply allows client user agents to retrieve
</I>&gt;<i> and manipulate resources stored on a server. It follows that a single

</I>&gt;<i> but what would that protocol look like?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first place to look for the answer is limitations in HTTP itself. For a
</I>&gt;<i> start the protocol doesn't care about the payload it carries (beyond its Internet
</I>&gt;<i> media type &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type</A>&gt;, such as
</I>&gt;<i> text/html), which doesn't bode well for realising the vision&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Activity.html">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Activity.html</A>&gt;of the [

Surely it should be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to add some structure to that data in the simplest way possible,
</I>&gt;<i> without having to resort to carrying complex, opaque file formats (as is the
</I>&gt;<i> case today)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally any such scaffolding added would be as light as possible, providing
</I>&gt;<i> key attributes common to all objects (such as updated time) as well as basic
</I>&gt;<i> metadata such as contributors, categories, tags and links to alternative
</I>&gt;<i> versions. The entire web is built on hyperlinks so it follows that the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to link between resources would be key, and these links should be
</I>&gt;<i> flexible such that we can describe relationships in some amount of detail.
</I>&gt;<i> The protocol would also be capable of carrying opaque payloads (as HTTP does
</I>&gt;<i> today) and for bonus points transparent ones that the server can seamlessly
</I>&gt;<i> understand too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like HTTP this protocol would not impose restrictions on the type of data
</I>&gt;<i> it could carry but it would be seamlessly (and safely) extensible so as to
</I>&gt;<i> support everything from contacts to contracts, biographies to books (or
</I>&gt;<i> entire libraries!). Messages should be able to be serialised for storage
</I>&gt;<i> and/or queuing as well as signed and/or encrypted to ensure security.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, despite significant performance improvements introduced in HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1 it would need to be able to stream many (possibly millions) of objects
</I>&gt;<i> as efficiently as possible in a single request too. Already we're asking a
</I>&gt;<i> lot from something that must be extremely simple and easy to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XML
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that this &quot;new&quot; protocol is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be XML based, building on top of HTTP in order to take advantage of
</I>&gt;<i> the extensive existing infrastructure. Those of us who know even a little
</I>&gt;<i> about XML will be ready to point out that the &quot;X&quot; in XML means &quot;eXtensible&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> so we need to be specific as to the schema for this assertion to mean
</I>&gt;<i> anything. This is where things get interesting. We could of course go down

</I>&gt;<i> Infrastructure Services (IaaS). To do so it needs to allow clients to
</I>&gt;<i> enumerate and manipulate an arbitrary number of server side &quot;resources&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (from one to many millions) all via a single entry point. These compute,
</I>&gt;<i> network and storage resources need to be able to be created, retrieved,

</I>&gt;<i> them (e.g. virtual machines linking to storage devices and network

</I>&gt;<i> The OCCI working group basically has two options now in order to deliver an

</I>&gt;<i> choke with anything more than a modest number of objects and we're talking
</I>&gt;<i> about potentially millions) but there are a raft of intellectual property

<PRE>Gary,
	Couple of points:

|<i>provider not offering those services. The OCCI cannot reconcile
</I>|<i>providers with incompatible infrastructures. In this example, the OCCI
</I>|<i>can only provide a vehicle  for the consumer to assess the capabilities
</I>|<i>of a provider.
</I>&lt;KS&gt;	We only provide interfaces et al. But it is not binary - folks
can offer a subset or superset of capabilities &lt;/KS&gt;

|<i>Reiterating, I think we need to include more virtualized services and
</I>|<i>virtualized hardware configurations.
</I>&lt;KS&gt;	I thought that is what we are doing ... because, underneath the
instances can handle the specification in a multitude of ways and we are
not prescriptive of any instantiation ... &lt;/KS&gt;

|<i>lemme get a few more cups of coffee...
</I>&lt;KS&gt;	Good idea ... am going to get some tea and will be back in a few
... too many discussions internally and externally on this ... need more
juice ...&lt;/KS&gt;

Cheers
&lt;k/&gt;

</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>I was on the same wavelength as you are until about a 3 days ago, I was
</I>|<i>getting xVM working on opensolaris. xVM para-virtualization has a
</I>|<i>concept of a virtual MAC address not tied to a physical MAC. This
</I>allows
|<i>them to create virtual HBA devices that can request IP addresses from
</I>|<i>DHCP. The virtual MAC helps routers and switches find the VM when its
</I>|<i>instantiated or transported to another rack or facility.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>I'm reconsidered my past position on what's relegated to fabric in lieu
</I>|<i>of a more comprehensive definition of IaaS.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Lets look at some provider models:
</I>|<i>1) A provider has hard iron that they physically provision for a
</I>|<i>customer ( the dedicated hw model/ no sharing of anything)
</I>|<i>2) A provider has pooled iron that they logically provision (fixed
</I>|<i>resources/dedicated hw) specific for a customer ( the LPAR model). This
</I>|<i>includes blades, minis, 100 cpu racks.
</I>|<i>3) A provider has pooled iron that shared resource provisioning occurs
</I>|<i>across customers ( the dynamic model).
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Irrespective of how the provider model fulfills its services, each are
</I>|<i>providing specific items: CPUs, memory, network adapters, storage HBAs,
</I>|<i>raw disk, filers, networks, VPNs, load balancers, web caches, name
</I>|<i>servers, edge firewalls, etc...
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>In the first case --- physical partitioning providers, the
</I>|<i>infrastructure is hard iron and no doubt fabric. In the second two
</I>|<i>models, LPAR and VM, all of the servers may be partially or completely
</I>|<i>visualized. We need to address what this really means for the both the
</I>|<i>providers and the consumers.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Providers have a pool of resources they provision for each customer. I
</I>|<i>assume each set of resources would/can be organized into one or more
</I>|<i>federated accounts. Federations can be further subdivided into
</I>|<i>administrative resources groups (zones).  Each federation is logically
</I>|<i>isolated from all other accounts for security and privacy constraints
</I>|<i>and possibly quality agreements.  The quality, availability,
</I>|<i>responsiveness, besides types of services offered are several ways
</I>|<i>providers differentiate themselves.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Consumers receiving federated pool of resources, can administer them
</I>|<i>according to their IT and business requirements. The administration can
</I>|<i>include fire walling internal to the federation, VPN connections
</I>between
|<i>federations and zones, and balancing external workload across multiple
</I>|<i>applications servers, Essentially, executing the same organizational
</I>and
|<i>administrative tasks occurring in private data centers.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Unless there are hard requirements for physical isolation or dedicated
</I>|<i>hardware, consumers will not care whether their infrastructure is
</I>|<i>physically partitioned, implemented as LPARs, floating VMs or how
</I>|<i>closely services are linked to fabric resources.. Consumers will expect
</I>|<i>or require certain levels of quality from their service..
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Bottom line:
</I>|<i>Consumer services are defined by the providers; not all providers offer
</I>|<i>the same services; and how a provider implements of their services, as
</I>|<i>far as occi concerns,  are unrelated to their service offerings.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>IMO, I don't think we can exclude cloud service providers because their
</I>|<i>services are too &quot;close&quot; to the fabric. We need to include virtualized
</I>|<i>hardware parameters like MACs as well as other infrastructure services
</I>|<i>including DNS, firewalls and VPNs.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>In the world, there are going to be varying degrees of compatibility
</I>|<i>betweens cloud provider technologies and service offerings. Some
</I>|<i>differences can be easily be worked around, while other may be
</I>|<i>irreconcilable; while all supporting and implementing occi.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>For example, virtual MACs are a hard reality and a critical attribute
</I>|<i>for some providers. Even though they are not required by all providers,
</I>|<i>it may not be a good idea to exclude them. In this case, the OCCI can
</I>|<i>accommodate both type of providers by acting as a superset for network
</I>|<i>adapter configurations. A provider not requiring a MAC address for
</I>their
|<i>operations can ignored the parameter.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>The idea that ALL occi cloud providers will be 100% inter-operating in
</I>|<i>the face of differentiated (missing or incompatible)  service offering
</I>|<i>is unrealistic.  For example, if a consumer has an application
</I>requiring
|<i>infrastructure provided load balancing services, they cannot engage a
</I>|<i>provider not offering those services. The OCCI cannot reconcile
</I>|<i>providers with incompatible infrastructures. In this example, the OCCI
</I>|<i>can only provide a vehicle  for the consumer to assess the capabilities
</I>|<i>of a provider.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>Reiterating, I think we need to include more virtualized services and
</I>|<i>vituralized hardware configurations.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>lemme get a few more cups of coffee...

</I>|&gt;<i>     The question is: &quot; Do operating systems belong in IaaS or PaaS. &quot;
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> Definitely IaaS. When you start talking about MAC addresses, VLAN
</I>IDs,
|&gt;<i> etc. you're venturing well into the underlying hardware fabric which
</I>|&gt;<i> is ultimately someone else's problem - I don't see any of these
</I>things
|&gt;<i> appearing in current IaaS APIs[1].
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> Basically think of infrastructure services as everything up to the
</I>|&gt;<i> operating system interface (be that an API, CLI or a GUI).
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> Platform services (PaaS) on the other hand include [most of] the
</I>|&gt;<i> solution stack... any app servers, databases, script/bytecode
</I>|&gt;<i> interpreters, etc. - think LAMP. You can just take your app and use
</I>it
|&gt;<i> (in many was like it were a virtual machine - which is why the next
</I>|&gt;<i> step for us will be a small one).
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> Software services (SaaS) then add the application itself.
</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> OCCI is most definitely IaaS.

</I>|&gt;<i>
</I>|&gt;<i> 1. That is not to say they're not important - they are, particularly
</I>|&gt;<i> for &quot;I can't believe it's not cloud&quot; moreso than public cloud, but if
</I>|&gt;<i> they appear in OCCI they'll be optional.

</I>&gt;<i> There are problems with doing this, because networks are note nodes,

</I>&gt;<i> then there is no way to show different capacites between different

</I>&gt;<i> connect to every other edge, and there as a way to indicate bandwidth 
</I>&gt;<i> between edge points, then there is no way to show that some

</I>&gt;<i> may block each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind it is good to consider network as a basic topological

</I>&gt;<i> network.  Routing between networks may need more policy or hints than 
</I>&gt;<i> routing within a domain, so it may be necessary to share properties of 
</I>&gt;<i> networks when routing between networks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that this is very similar to creating an abstact view of a

</I>&gt;<i> abstract views.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in what others think about this.
</I>My idea on the node was simply to define it as such:

A node has interfaces to the outside world and can be comprised of 
elements underneath.

With that defintion, network simply becomes a subclass of node. That's 
not to say that it won't be a proper subclass with its own set of 
attributes, but just that it's a type of node. Passing around node 
elements with no meaningful way to differentiate them would be silly, 
but keeping like concepts as similar as possible I think is a good thing.

What we need to have is a clear definition of 'network', how it is going 
to be used, and why we used the generic term network to describe that 
concept. How are domain and network different and what is the 
differentiating factor? If we have the two level approach of a domain 
has networks but networks only contain nodes/links/ports, why not allow 
networks in networks? Also, why not allow nodes to be in multiple 
networks if an external set of interfaces at some level can be defined 
for that network (thinking in the overlay network perspective). 
Especially since 'network' is a general term, these kinds of questions 
need answers.

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Aaron

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overloaded

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But otherwise, thanks for writing this up. This is really close to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I see two concepts here: an (administrative) network 
</I>&gt;<i> domain, and a filtered view. The relational difference is that a 
</I>&gt;<i> device can only be part of ONE &quot;domain&quot;, but part of MULTIPLE &quot;views&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i> Evangelos, does that mean you like to have both a &quot;domain&quot; object
</I>&gt;<i> for grouping, and another &quot;view&quot; object that gives you a filtered view 
</I>&gt;<i> of the contents of this group? Or do you only want one &quot;View&quot; object 
</I>&gt;<i> that is just some grouping of network elements?
</I>A &quot;view&quot; can be more than a simple grouping or filtering; it could be
a complete restructuring of the network elements. The most common
use case in the control plane world would be reducing a network to a
simpler topology, and possibly obfuscating device and interface names,
to safely provide the data to an untrusted party.

In general, a domain might offer different views of its topology with
varying complexity and parameters, each targeted to a different
class of applications. I think that's what Aurelin is shooting for,
and I think it's a great idea.

Anyway, here's what I think that sort of structure would look like:

- Domain
--- View (type = &quot;monitoring&quot;)
------ Network Element
------ Network Element
-------- Network Element
------ ....
--- View (type = &quot;controlplane&quot;)
------ Network Element
------ Network Element
------ ....
--- View (type = &quot;export&quot;)
------ Network Element
-------- Network Element
------ Network Element
------ ....

and so on and so forth.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we need a third &quot;network&quot; concept for grouping, besides (or instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of) &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;view&quot;? If so, what would be the relation between 
</I>&gt;<i> devices and such &quot;network&quot; and how is that different from &quot;domain&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;view&quot;?
</I>I'm on the fence as to whether we need a separate &quot;network&quot; concept. We 
might
need to model administrative domains that run multiple independent 
networks.
Examples: the GEANT testbed network vs the GEANT production network, or
ESnet Science Data Network vs ESNet IP core vs ESnet optical testbed. 
Devices
may belong to multiple of these &quot;networks&quot;, too.

I kindof think that each of these may be safely modeled as an 
administrative domain
of its own, but that breaks the device-&gt;single domain relation. Or, we 
can describe
each with its own View, which makes for a simpler schema but may not be
100% semantically correct. Any feedback is appreciated.





&gt;<i> Did the IDC project made such choices already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (My opinion: I like to see at least an (admin)domain object, and 
</I>&gt;<i> possibly a &quot;view&quot; object. I don't yet see a need for a &quot;network&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> object different from a &quot;domain&quot; object. Nevertheless, Aaron presented 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly those two, and I love to hear that argument).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We haven't made hard choices per se. We're working on automatically
&quot;abstracting&quot; network topologies for export. The abstracted view of the
topology needs to be made persistent.. so we came up with a  database
construct similar to the above.

<PRE>Evangelos wrote about the &quot;Model&quot; object:

&gt;<i> Can we call them &quot;Views&quot; instead of &quot;Models&quot;? &quot;Model&quot; is a quite overloaded
</I>&gt;<i> word, especially in a semantic context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But otherwise, thanks for writing this up. This is really close to work 
</I>&gt;<i> currently under development in the IDC project.
</I>
Currently, I see two concepts here: an (administrative) network domain, 
and a filtered view. The relational difference is that a device can only 
be part of ONE &quot;domain&quot;, but part of MULTIPLE &quot;views&quot;.

Evangelos, does that mean you like to have both a &quot;domain&quot; object
for grouping, and another &quot;view&quot; object that gives you a filtered view 
of the contents of this group? Or do you only want one &quot;View&quot; object 
that is just some grouping of network elements?

Do we need a third &quot;network&quot; concept for grouping, besides (or instead 
of) &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;view&quot;? If so, what would be the relation between 
devices and such &quot;network&quot; and how is that different from &quot;domain&quot; or 
&quot;view&quot;?

Did the IDC project made such choices already?

(My opinion: I like to see at least an (admin)domain object, and 
possibly a &quot;view&quot; object. I don't yet see a need for a &quot;network&quot; object 
different from a &quot;domain&quot; object. Nevertheless, Aaron presented exactly 
those two, and I love to hear that argument).

I think that a &quot;domain&quot; object (with each device only part of one 
domain) can already have this black-box abstraction. However, the &quot;view&quot; 
object is more flexible, and allows either a more detailed view (a 
network domain with some more details described) or a more abstract view 
(two or three domains abstracted as a single cloud) -- I am not sure how 
that would work in practice though, so suggestions are welcome.


&gt;<i> &quot;Does NML have to provide the extreme details of a real network such as patch panel ?&quot;
</I>
My opinion: no, but it should be extensible enough so that someone may 
later do that. (Perhaps by describing them as &quot;devices&quot; without 
switching capability, or by introducing a new object).

Freek

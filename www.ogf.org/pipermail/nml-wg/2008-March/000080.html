I agree with your statement that it is useful to talk about an actual 
network, knowing that it really is that network and not some abstract view.

Could you define &quot;real topology&quot; for me? Is that a single network 
(controlled by a single domain), or is that all networks together?
If it is all together -- I like to emphasize that I prefer that there is 
a concept of a common real topology, but no-one has full knowledge of 
this real topology (likely they have a full knowledge on the local 
domain, and abstracted views of other domains).


&gt;<i> 2. The &quot;real&quot; topology includes information about control of 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities - the administrative owner(s), the operational owner(s), 
</I>&gt;<i> and any device that can activate the capabilities.
</I>
Yes, and I would distinguish between the physical &quot;network&quot; class and 
the organisational &quot;domain&quot; class (which is the administrator of a network)

A few notes on terminology: after discussions a couple of years ago, I 
now distinguish between
- juridical owner
- economic owner
- administrator = operator

Where the administrator is the same as the operator: the entity that 
enforces policies, and the economic owner is the entity that decides on 
policies.


&gt;<i> 3. The real topology has groups - which might be called networks, or 
</I>&gt;<i> domains or both.  It is not clear exactly how this will work.
</I>
You previously said that you want to have a &quot;common&quot; real topology. Does 
the grouping of this real topology in domains should also be common? 
Thus is it the same for everyone, or could device A be in domain 8 for 
me, while it is in domain 11 for you?

I hope there is such a common grouping of all network elements into 
networks, and everyone sees the same networks. However, I'm fine to have 
an additional &quot;view&quot; concept where other entities may see different views.

&gt;<i> DCN views
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> An internal topological view of a domain will include all the 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities that are in a domain and the devices that contain the 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilites.  In the simple case this is all the nodes and links in the 
</I>&gt;<i> domain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An external topological view of a domain includes the links to external 
</I>&gt;<i> domains and the internal device to which the link is connected.  It also 
</I>&gt;<i> includes the capabilities of the domain to act on external links.
</I>
I do not see why it is necessary to know about the terminating device 
for links in the external view. It seems to me that all I need to know 
is the encoding of the link, the the capabilities of the domain 
('network' in my terminology) to act on this link.

&gt;<i> A DCN internal pathfinding view contains Nodes and links for a domain.  
</I>&gt;<i> The nodes and links may correspond to the real topology or may be 
</I>&gt;<i> virtual links that are created by combining connections between 
</I>&gt;<i> locations into a single link (e.g. 4 GEs between sites are treated as a 
</I>&gt;<i> single link for pathfinding purposes) or by splitting connections into 
</I>&gt;<i> different links (e.g. STS-1-48= link1, STS-49-96 = link2).
</I>
Good. We need a discussion about links. But you seem to suggest that 
according to you a &quot;link&quot; is equal to a ITU-T G.805 &quot;link connection&quot; 
(that is, logical links). &quot;Splitting&quot; is not a word I would use though.

Your example is pretty complex. Do you also want to be able to (a) say 
that the STS-1-48 link is composed of 48 distinct STS channels? (b) do 
you want to be able to say that link1 and link2 are in fact transported 
over the same OC-192? If so, you need rather detailed multiplexing and 
adaptation classes to describe this.

&gt;<i> A DCN external pathfinding view contains domains and links between 
</I>&gt;<i> domains.  There is some question as to whether a domain should be 
</I>&gt;<i> abstracted to look like a node.  My view is that from a DCN operational 
</I>&gt;<i> view they are different.
</I>
So do you propose that we have a distinct &quot;domain&quot; and a &quot;node&quot; class? 
Could you define them for me, so I know the difference between the two?

&gt;<i> routes inside domain are calculated between 
</I>&gt;<i> nodes.  routes between domains are calculated between edges of domains.
</I>
I may do path finding in a completely different way (I may look at 
interfaces and the grouping in nodes/devices/domains altogether). I 
think such implementation details are firmly out of scope of the NML. 
What is in scope is that there is enough information for you to do the 
path finding.

&gt;<i> I am not sure if the elements in a path 
</I>&gt;<i> request need to have a topological name.
</I>
How do you want to refer to an element? How other then it's name? (This 
is not a rethoric question! A valid answer may be &quot;by it's properties&quot;.)


Finally, you wrote in your first sentence that you &quot;like to pursue the 
concept of view or model&quot;. Good. However, you only defined &quot;internal 
topological view&quot; and &quot;external topological view&quot;. I think that this 
distinction can already be handled by the &quot;network&quot; concept. A network 
has capabilities, external links, and a bunch of internal network 
elements. For the internal view, I list it all. For the external view, I 
only announce the capabilities and external links. I do not see the need 
to define another &quot;view&quot; class or &quot;model&quot; class to accomplish this.

I do like the &quot;view&quot; concept, but I have not really seen a convincing 
argument for it. The one that came close was Evangelos mail of March 4 
[1], where he had different views for monitoring and other services.
In the end, we always give a limited set of information to our 
neighbours. That is a view on our full topology knowledge of our own 
network. That is always possible. However, if we later want to *refer* 
to this specific set of information, then we want to name this &quot;view&quot;.

Freek

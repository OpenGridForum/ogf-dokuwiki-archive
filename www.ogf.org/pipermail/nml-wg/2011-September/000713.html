<PRE>Here is another proposal, on Adaptation.

Serial compound links can be SPECIFIED using a &quot;serial_compound&quot;
relation between Link objects. Serial compound links can also be DERIVED
from the source and sink relation between Links and Ports. If Link A has
sink Port X, and Link B has source Port X, then it follows that Link A
and B are placed in series.

Proposal: I think we should treat adaptation similar to links. This
means that we need two thinks:
- a &quot;Adaptation&quot; object that describes the adaptation (data encoding)
function between Ports, similar to how a Link describes a data transport
function.
- a &quot;adaptation&quot; relation between Links, meaning that one Link (on the
'server' layer) provides connectivity to another Link (on the 'client'
layer)

The adaptation relation can thus be SPECIFIED between Links using a
&quot;adaptation&quot; relation, and it can also be DERIVED by considering the
source and sink relations between Links and Ports and between
Adaptations and Ports.
In this proposal, the &quot;adaptation&quot; relation only exists between Links,
not between Ports. This is different from the description of adaptation
in NDL (which is defined as a Predicate between Interface -- similar to
a relation between Ports).


Open issues:
- it may be confusing to have both a &quot;Adaptation&quot; object and
&quot;adaptation&quot; relation with the same name (especially if the &quot;adaptation&quot;
relation is between Links, not to/from a &quot;Adaptation&quot; object. I gladly
accept proposals for a better name.
- Link and Adaptation are similar. Rather than a new object in the UML
schema, it is possible to create a common parent class (e.g. create a
&quot;DataTransport&quot; class below the &quot;Network Object&quot; class, and make Link
and Adaptation class children of &quot;DataTransport&quot;). It may be possible to
use the same class for Link and Adaptation (and distinguish between e.g.
a &quot;Type&quot; attribute -- and yes, that is ironic, given the proposal in my
previous email). I think just adding a new class is easiest, but I
gladly hear other opinions.

Regards,
Freek

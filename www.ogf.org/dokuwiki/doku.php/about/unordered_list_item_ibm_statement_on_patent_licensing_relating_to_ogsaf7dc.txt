IBM is pleased to announce that any essential patent claims, held by IBM, that are necessary to implement the "Grid Services Specification" document submitted to the Global Grid Forum, will be licensed on a royalty-free basis. The "Grid Services Specification" is built upon both Grid and Web Services technologies, referred to as the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). Like Web Services and XML before it, this foundational Grid work will be an essential part of the Web and network infrastructure for businesses, as well as for governments and scientific institutions.

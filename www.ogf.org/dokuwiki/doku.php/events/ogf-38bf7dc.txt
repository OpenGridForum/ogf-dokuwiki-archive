===== OGF-38b =====

[[https://www.xsede.org/web/xsede13/|XSEDE13]], which takes place July 22-25, 2013 in San Diego, is the second annual conference for the international XSEDE community. This event will showcase the discoveries, innovations, and achievements of those who use, build, and support XSEDE resources and other cyberinfrastructure resources around the world. 

Because the opportunity for the OGF Networking Community to meet at [[events:ogf-38a:| OGF38a]] June 6-7, 2013 just after the [[https://tnc2013.terena.org/|Terena 2013 Networking Conference]] will not provide enough meeting space to accommodate the full range of OGF working groups, a broader set of OGF meetings is scheduled to take place during [[https://www.xsede.org/web/xsede13/|XSEDE13]]. This set of OGF tracks will be called **OGF 38b**.

The theme of XSEDE13 is Gateway to Discovery, which highlights the impact of community-designed web interfaces that provide transparent access to XSEDE resources and services. However, submissions on non-gateway topics in science and engineering research; systems and middleware technology; software and software environments; and training, education and outreach services (TEOS) are welcome in all parts of the conference.

OGF will be holding working group meetings during XSEDE13, and the call for participation in these tracks is now open. To express interest in space and one or more time slots for your working group meetings at this event, please follow the link on the [[events:ogf-38b:call_for_session_proposals|Call for Session Proposals]] page.

**All OGF working groups are encouraged to meet.** This event should be of special interest to the Security and Infrastructure Areas, including our [[http://occi-wg.org|OCCI]] and other cloud-related working and community groups, taking advantage of meetings earlier in the week of the separate [[http://kelsey.web.cern.ch/kelsey/venue.html|EUGridPMA and SCI meetings nearby in Abingdon]] and the [[https://indico.egi.eu/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1986|EGI Federated Cloud face-to-face meeting in Oxford]]. Other OGF group meetings to take place during OGF-40 include the Basic Execution Services, GLUE and JSDL working groups. There will be an OGF Town Hall and meetings of the Grid Forum Steering Group and the Nominating Committee.

===== OGF Areas and Groups =====


The OGF Areas are organized for development of architectures, specifications, roadmaps and glossaries for distributed computing software through OGF community groups and working groups. These groups produce their respective output through application of the OGF document process. This work also includes the management of technical liaisons with other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and the promotion of the adoption of standardized and interoperable distributed computing software.

===== Applications Area =====

Area Director: Wolfgang Ziegler, Fraunhofer SCAI (Germany)

The Applications Area explores grid application development issues and programming interfaces required by grid applications.

		<strong>Wiki Reference Guide Available for Industry Use and Update</strong>
		<br>
		<br>

		<strong>LEMONT, Ill. (May 10, 2006)</strong> - Global Grid Forum (<a href="http://www.ggf.org/">www.ggf.org</a>) today
		announced an online reference guide of specifications and standards for
		the management of networked resources. Compiled by experts from cross
		institutional standards bodies throughout the world, this reference
		guide is designed to grow and develop with the industry. The wiki
		<a href="http://www.ggf.org/scrm-wiki/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ggf.org/scrm-wiki/index.htm</a> 
		is available to view by anyone involved in
		grid or management technologies, free-of-charge, and does not require
		registration.
		<br>
		<br>

		Developed in wiki form, the information will be continuously updated by
		grid and resource management professionals throughout the world. Experts
		and institutions interested in adopting or researching these technologies
		are encouraged to submit additional information as appropriate. The
		Global Grid Forum and the various standards bodies have established
		strict submission, data review and publishing requirements to maintain
		the integrity and legitimacy of information posted to this wiki. 
		<br>
		<br>

		Created within Global Grid Forum's working group known as the Standards
		Development Organization Collaboration on Networked Resources Management
		(SCRM), this reference guide represents a collective volume of relevant
		standards from    leading industry bodies including the Global Grid Forum
		(GGF), the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), the Organization
		for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the
		Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), the Tele Management Forum
		(TMF), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the International
		Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector
		(ITU-T), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>GGF</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		"GGF is excited to be the venue for all these respected and established
		organizations to come together and work collaboratively to produce a
		landscape of standards for the management of networked resources," said Mark
		Linesch, Chairman of Global Grid Forum. "This landscape and our continued
		work together helps to insure a better understanding of the relationship
		between various industry standards - enabling more effective communication
		and identifying opportunties for future collaboration".
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>DMTF</strong>

		<br>
		<br>
		"The DMTF is continuing its long-standing commitment to sharing its
		expertise in distributed management infrastructure and resource modeling
		by participating in this online reference guide," said Winston Bumpus,
		chair, DMTF. "Our active collaboration with the leading SDOs in the SCRM
		group helps ensure that the DMTF's Common Information Model, Systems
		Management Architecture for Server Hardware and Web-Based Enterprise
		Management standards address the industry's requirements, including
		those for utility computing, grid technology and virtualization. The wiki
		reference guide is providing real-time collaborative opportunities, and
		we look forward to taking advantage of this resource to help coordinate
		standards initiatives for the benefit of the industry."
		<br>
		<br>

		<strong>SNIA</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		"The SNIA's Storage Management Initiative Specification, as part of the
		SCRM landscape project, is an integral building block for integrated
		IT standards-based management stacks that improve interoperability and
		reduce IT integration efforts", said Wayne M. Adams, Chairman of the
		SNIA. "As the SNIA expands SMI-S features for data management and brings
		new complimentary standards to the landscape such as the eXtensible
		Access Method, managing information as it correlates to its physical
		placement can be realized."

		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>ITU-T</strong>

		<br>
		<br>
		"ITU-T is pleased to be able to support this GGF initiative and strongly
		appreciates the spirit of cooperation that has allowed it." said Dave
		Sidor, ITU-T SG 4 Chairman. "The sharing of information, pooling of
		resources and the recognition of the need to work together to avoid the
		duplication of work and most efficiently serve industry are activities
		that increasingly characterize the standards world. And so we applaud
		every new effort in this vein."

		<strong>About Global Grid Forum:</strong> 

		<br>
		<br>
		The Global Grid Forum (GGF) is the community of users, developers,
		and vendors leading the global standardization effort for grid
		computing. The GGF community consists of thousands of individuals in
		industry and research, representing over 400 organizations in more
		than 50 countries. Together we work for the pervasive adoption of grid
		computing worldwide because we believe grids will lead to new discoveries,
		new opportunities, and better business practices. The work of GGF is
		carried out though community-initiated working groups, which develop
		best practices and specifications in cooperation with other leading
		standards organizations, software vendors, and users. GGF is funded
		through its Sponsor Members, including technology producers and consumers
		as well as academic and government research institutions. GGF meets as
		a worldwide community three times annually to share best practices and
		further develop grid-related specifications. For more info about GGF,

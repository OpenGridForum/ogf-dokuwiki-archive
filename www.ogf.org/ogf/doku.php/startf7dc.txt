===== Open Grid Forum =====

=== An Open Global Forum for Advanced Distributed Computing ===

**OGF** is an open global community committed to driving the rapid evolution and adoption of modern advanced applied distributed computing, including cloud, grid and associated storage, networking and workflow methods. OGF is focused on developing and promoting innovative scalable techniques, applications and infrastructures to improve productivity in the enterprise and within the international research, science and business communities. 

OGF accomplishes its work through **open forums, interactions and events** that build the community, explore trends, share optimal approaches, document findings and consolidate these results where appropriate into standards. The output products that result from this process document and codify best practices and standards that provide the basis for some of the largest and most powerful operational computing infrastructure systems in the world.

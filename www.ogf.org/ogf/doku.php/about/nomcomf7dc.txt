=== About the NOMCOM ===

The [[http://ogf.org/documents/GFD.116.pdf|NOMCOM]] solicits and selects or recommends candidates to fill OGF leadership positions, such as Vice Presidents, Area Directors and at-large Board Members. It gives the OGF community a way to influence who serves in these positions and also gives the chosen members a community mandate. 

The current 2014 NOMCOM initiated at OGF 40 can be contacted through the Chair: [[mailto:andre@merzky.net|Andre Merzky]]

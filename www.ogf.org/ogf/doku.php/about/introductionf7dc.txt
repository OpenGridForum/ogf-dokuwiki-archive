The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is the global forum in which people in science, business, and government work to ensure that IT infrastructures can meet the needs of today's knowledge-based economy through the use of open and barrier-free computing technologies. OGF fosters adoption of advanced computing by developing open standards for software interoperability and by providing an open forum for innovation. The people supporting OGF believe that standards-based computing is critical to meeting the business and scientific needs of the 21st century. 

==== Delivering Value ====

OGF's current suite of more than 200 published documents includes numerous specifications and papers that document the experience of grid software providers implementing those specifications. OGF addresses critical interoperability issues such as scheduling jobs across multiple application platforms; describing and accessing distributed data such as databases, files, or XML repositories; managing the deployment of various applications in a distributed environment; and providing a uniform API for grid-enabling applications. 

OGF organizes international events three times a year to align requirements, identify and remove barriers to grid adoption, explore related technologies, and record best practices of grid usage. To date, we have hosted 29 events in Europe, North America and Asia with proceedings archived and openly available on the OGF web site. 

OGF collaborates extensively with other standards development organizations in networking, storage, data management, and web standards to ensure the alignment of existing industry standards with specifications that enable grid, cloud and other distributed computing software, middleware, and hardware interoperability. 


==== Structured for Success ====

OGF was formed in 2006 from the merger of the Global Grid Forum (GGF) and the Enterprise Grid Alliance (EGA). GGF had a rich history and established international presence within the academic and research communities while EGA was specifically focused on developing and promoting enterprise grid solutions. Today, OGF is a community-driven, open organization structured to enable focused leadership, accountability and fast decision-making throughout the various levels of the organization. 

Group Chairs manage topic-specific groups whose charters dictate the scope of work, intended deliverables, and milestones for completion. Group Chairs benefit from Area Directors who guide groups through core processes of formation, publication, and other chartered activities. The OGF President, functional Vice Presidents, and Area Directors work at the strategic level to ensure OGF's technical direction is consistent with industry requirements, emerging technologies, and work in other standards organizations. OGF work is focused into three functions and seven standards areas as shown in Figure 1. 

 

==== MOVING FORWARD ====

OGF is completely focused on the goal that users can build operational grids using OGF-defined standards, protocols, and best practices. In order to accomplish this goal, we review the OGF technical strategy and roadmap (living document) with our key stakeholders to ensure alignment and updated prioritization. We strive to capture the latest information and thinking that will help us:
Identify the main, common use-cases, patterns, and scenarios that users require
Develop best practice documents that allow users to adopt Grids today and provide a pathway for the standards process
Add to the core architectural standards required to build robust, commercially viable, grid solutions
Encourage software developers to implement standards in products
 

==== Engaged Membership ====

Over 40 organizations - private and public - including IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, fund and participate in the Open Grid Forum. Hundreds of Grid experts and luminaries from across the globe contribute their skill and expertise to the organization. The OGF Membership Program delivers clear benefits to all constituents in an open, transparent manner helping ensure broad technical participation and adequate funding to accomplish our mission. Member benefits include: 

  * INFLUENCE      -- On Directions and Priorities 
  * RECOGNITION -- As a Leader Driving Grid Adoption
  * ACCESS            -- To Grid Experts and Information 

Working together, we share information, prioritize requirements, develop standards and best practices, and champion the application and adoption of grid worldwide. 


==== Get Involved ====

Help us shape the future of grid technologies and standards by getting involved in the OGF community. 

It's easy to do... attend an upcoming event to present your work or to learn and network with peers, contribute to one of our groups by reviewing documents and participating in discussions in your area of expertise, implement grid requirements by writing software that use OGF standards or become a member and enjoy the important benefits.

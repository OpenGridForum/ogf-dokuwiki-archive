===== OGF Liaisons =====

The Open Grid Forum (OGF) works closely with other standards organizations to increase collaboration throughout the industry through our liaison area. Liaisons enable OGF to work more effectively to better define the overall grid standards landscape including developing more consistent definitions and taxonomy. As standards organizations, we realize that the pervasive adoption and standardization of grid computing takes 'a community'. This forms the basis for exploring communication mechanisms and projects that can speed the delivery of industry standards while better communicating interactions, dependencies and status to sponsors and the industry at large. 

OGF has liaison activities with key standards organizations such as IETF, W3C, OASIS, and WS/I , SNIA, DMTF and others. The table below lists current liaison contacts for OGF.

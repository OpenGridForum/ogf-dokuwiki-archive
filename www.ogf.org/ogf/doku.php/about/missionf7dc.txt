===== The OGF Vision =====

**

The Open Grid Forum accelerates adoption of advanced computing to enable business value and scientific discovery 
by providing open processes for developing open documentation and standards for software interoperability.\\
\\
OGF provides an open forum that brings together key individuals and organizations from the advanced computing community 
to align requirements; identify and remove barriers; test and develop best practices that will expedite their adoption.\\
\\
As an open organization, OGF collaborates extensively with other related organizations and develops and maintains 
liaisons as needed to align with existing industry standards and develop new methods, best practices and standard specifications.\\
\\
OGF exists to serve the community and pursues its interactions with other organizations and with the community 
with the goal to identify, document, curate where necessary, and promote adoption of the best available methods in all cases.\\

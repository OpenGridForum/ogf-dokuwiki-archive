<p>
The Open Grid Forum (OGF) was formed from the merger of the Global
Grid Forum (GGF) and the Enterprise Grid Alliance (EGA). GGF had a
rich history and established international presence within the
academic and research communities along with a growing participation
from industry. EGA was a consortium focused on developing and
promoting enterprise grid solutions. Together, we have the opportunity
to deliver faster results, communicate more clearly and collaborate
more effectively with other grid organizations and standards bodies.

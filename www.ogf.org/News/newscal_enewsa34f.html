	    <br>
As we enter the new year, I want to take a moment and thank you for your support, reflect on some of the highlights of the past year, and make you aware of some high-priority activities in progress.
<br>
<br>

Over the course of 2007, OGF continued to deliver many high-quality specifications that detailed standards-based approaches to essential grid interoperability issues.  During the recent Supercomputing '07 conference, ten separate OGF specifications or specifications in progress were demonstrated in numerous show booths. These demonstrations showed how implementations of OGF specifications enabled interoperability across heterogeneous platforms - the ultimate goal of standards.
<br>
<br>

Another very significant milestone in OGF's history was announced and highlighted during the show. Microsoft, Altair, and Platform Computing announced that OGF's High Performance Computing Basic Profile (HPC-BP) would be scheduled into future releases of their software, enabling customers to enjoy the benefits of interoperability in a multi-vendor environment. This, plus the intent to use HPC-BP in numerous national and regional production grids serving eScience communities around the world, made the announcement a significant accomplishment for OGF.
<br>
<br>

Also this year, OGF hosted its best-attended event ever during OGF20 in Manchester, UK.  This event, which was co-located with the Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) User Forum, attracted over 900 attendees and resulted in grid users from research and commercial verticals productively interacting with those chartered to create best practices, standards, and solutions.
<br>
<br>

Meanwhile, data challenges in both commercial and research environments prompted OGF to increase formal engagement in two high-profile activities. First, OGF signed a MoU with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) whose charter is to manage and distribute large quantities of geospatial data (i.e., anything that goes on a map). This initiative, along with a joint initiative with the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) around developing standards and best practices in data movement and data management, has brought data to the forefront of our activities moving forward.
<br>
<br>
 

Building on these successes in standards adoption, events, and organizational engagement across the distributed computing landscape, OGF must also strive to explore promising research topics and emerging technologies that are important to the future of grids and our community.  Clearly, data interoperability, virtualization, Web 2.0, muliticore processors, cloud computing, and service-oriented networks are all topics highly relevant to the evolution of the grid concept.  There is still much work to be done to make grid capabilities easy to adopt and effective to use across the spectrum of application domains and requirements.
<br>
<br>

Finally, I cannot stress how much of our success is based on our member's financial and technical engagement.  My sincere thanks to you all once again.  People from all over the world depend on OGF to provide them an open forum for engagement and open standards for interoperability. As OGF continues to deliver these essential services, we hope to enjoy your continued participation. I am delighted to be at the helm of this great organization. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments.

<strong>
Sustainable Multiscale Simulations using Grid Remote Procedure Call
</strong>
	    <br>
In scientific Grid environments, you often have many supercomputers or clusters distributed geographically across the world processing problem sizes that are not constant and may vary during the execution.  In such a scenario, how do you write application programs to effectively use the capacity of computing resources provided by thousands of processors for a long period of time like one month or even one year?  One way is to ensure your programming model satisfies the following requirements:
	    <br>
<ul class="body">
<li>
	Flexibility in resource allotment: the application must be written to request additional computing resource on-the-fly according to the availability
</li>
<li>
	Fault tolerance and robustness: the application must be able to automatically recover from cluster node or interconnection failures 
</li>
<li>
	Scalability in increasing the number of parallel activities: the application must be able to manage a large number of parallel activities effectively. 
</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is one well-known programming model for parallel applications, however simply extending MPI to Grid environments is not the answer.  That's because a MPI program will terminate when one of the MPI processes fails and it is hard to allocate and execute many resources across clusters simultaneously using MPI. 
	    <br>
	    <br>

GridRPC, a natural extension of remote procedure call (RPC) to the Grid environment, is the unique solution available that meets the critical requirements needed to write large scale applications for Grids.  When viewed at a very high abstraction level, the programming model provided by GridRPC is that of standard RPC plus asynchronous, coarse-grained parallel tasking.  At a more practical level, GridRPC provides a simple, yet powerful, client-server-based framework for programming on the Grid.

	    <br>
	    <br>
In September 2007, "A GridRPC Model and API for End-User Applications", which presents a model and API for GridRPC, was approved as a "Grid Recommendation" (or Standard) by the Open Grid Forum (OGF).  "Grid Recommendation" status can only be achieved after a "proposed recommendation" has at least two documented interoperable implementations. 

	    <br>
	    <br>
Last month at the SuperComputing 2007 show, the use of GRIDRPC for implementing large-scale, long-run, and adaptive Grid applications was demonstrated. In addition, simulation results of a relatively long H-diffusion path in an inhomogeneously nano-stressed gamma-alumina was presented.  Utilizing 1129 processors distributed on Trans-Pacific Grid infrastructure consisting of supercomputers in TeraGrid and AIST, the simulation was executed for approximately 60 hours. Regardless of the system faults, the simulation was continued by recovering from such faults and there was no manual restart of the simulation.  The experimental results prove that GridRPC is a promising approach to implementing sustainable Grid applications.  

	    <br>
	    <br>
The results of other large-scale empirical experiments have been shown at past  Supercomputing conferences.  Large-scale simulation of corrosion of Silicon under stress was presented at SC2004.  Utilizing 1793 processors in AIST and Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC), the simulation ran for approximately 12 hours.  In 2005, result of the larger-scale simulation of SIMOX (Separation by Implanted Oxygen) was presented.  A joint research group by AIST, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan, and the University of Southern California (USC), achieved an automated execution of multi-scale simulation on a Grid consisting of 6 supercomputer centers in Japan (AIST, the University of Tokyo, and Tokyo Institute of Technology) and the US (PSC, National Center for Supercomputing Alliance, and USC), in which the number of processors changes dynamically on demand and resource are allocated and migrated dynamically according to both reservations and unexpected faults.  The result of the 19 day experiment showed that GridRPC is able to implement a flexible (allow dynamic allocation and migration of resources), robust (detect faults and recover from such errors), and efficient (utilize thousands of processors) Grid applications.

	    <br>
	    <br>
The standardization of the GridRPC API will potentially make Grids easily accessible to thousands of users that are already familiar with using the RPC model for their scientific applications.  In fact, this standard has already enabled a growing user base such as Ninf-G, developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan; GridSolve, developed by the University of Tennessee Knoxville; and DIET, developed by Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique in France to take advantage of multiple implementations.

	    <br>
	    <br>
The OGF GridRPC working group is now tackling the issues of service discovery, introspection, persistent data, and workflow management and their proper expression within GridRPC.

			SC07 Report - Internet2 and Collaborators Demonstrate OGF Standards
	    </a>
	      </span>
	    <br>
At SC07, Internet2, together with several partners and collaborators, demonstrated for the first time interoperability of its Dynamic Circuit (DC) Network with multiple regional and international networks as well as an equipment provider. The interoperability of the Inter-Domain Controller (IDC) protocol, being developed in a collaboration between GEANT2, Internet2, and ESnet, is made possible through emerging network markup language (NML) standards being developed in the Open Grid Forum.
 
	    <br>
	    <br>
"For many years, Internet2 has been a contributor to the OGF standards process and we believe its plays a critical role in engaging and advancing the broad Internet development community," said Eric Boyd, Internet2 deputy technology officer. "It's gratifying to see the results of our community's efforts instantiated in new standards-based software that will provide immediate benefits to our members and the global networking and grid community."
	    <br>
	    <br>

The Internet2 demonstrations showcased interoperability with ESnet, GEANT2 in Europe, NYSERNET in New York, the Great Plains Network (GPN), GRNET in Greece, HEAnet in Ireland, Merit Network, Northern Crossroads (NoX), a Nortel Network based in Ottawa, Canada, the PIONIER network in Poland, and the Phosphorus testbed at the University of Amsterdam via SURFnet's NetherLight GLIF Open Lambda Exchange in Amsterdam. 
	    <br>
	    <br>

In doing so, the SC07 demonstration marked a major first step in enabling the widespread adoption of dynamic circuit networking by showcasing how networks with different equipment, network technology, and allocation models can dynamically provision dedicated circuits across domains.  
	    <br>
	    <br>

Dynamic circuit networks use web services to provide on-demand or scheduled dedicated point-to-point bandwidth in the spirit of grid computing to enable the most intensive applications for research and education to allocate the resources that they need when they need them. These include applications like massive terabyte-sized data transfers that will be critical for the high energy physics community when the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) comes online next year. 
	    <br>
	    <br>

In addition to the NML standards, Internet2 together with several collaborators also demonstrated the perfSONAR framework which is built on standards developed under the direction of the OGF Network Monitoring Working Group (NMWG). The core of the perfSONAR framework comprises a set of open protocol standards for interoperability between measurement and monitoring systems. Overall, perfSONAR can be viewed as a set of open source web services that can be combined and extended to create a real-time performance-monitoring framework.  As the protocols and models are open, deployments may choose between various implementations and may deploy as much or as little of the infrastructure as desired.
	    <br>
	    <br>

At SC07, perfSONAR was utilized to provide performance data on the Internet2 dynamic circuit network demonstrations. Because it is designed to understand the underlying topology of a network, including the complex hybrid IP/circuit network topologies that exist on the Internet2 Network, perfSONAR collected and reported performance data on the IP and dynamic circuit network links and provided visualization of the multiple gigabit data flows. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
perfSONAR's ability to share network diagnostic information across administrative domains makes it an important tool for projects like the LHC, and other collaborations between multiple national and international organizations. perfSONAR simplifies the troubleshooting and evaluation of performance issues across networksâallowing network administrators to diagnose and verify network problems across complex multi-domain topologies in near real time. 
	    <br>
	    <br>

Jeff Boote, senior network software engineer for the Internet2 Performance Architecture Team, noted "Developers of grid applications have long sought mechanisms to enable consistent and accurate feedback about network performance.  perfSONAR allows the network to provide this critical information proactively which in turn allows developers and users to make intelligent resource decisions at application run time.  By identifying performance issues on the spot, we believe perfSONAR can have a major impact on the future proliferation of grids and other high impact applications which depend upon network reliability and performance."

Financial Services Workshop - Wednesday, February 27
<br>
The financial services industry is one of the early adopters, and successful users, of Grid technology.  As the technology matures, new (and old) issues emerge like expanding grids to support transactional workloads, data management and movement, and putting policies in place for charging and tracking usage.  Presentations and case studies that describe the emerging issues the financial services industry is now facing in Grid will be featured in this half day workshop.

Pharma/Life Sciences Workshop - Wednesday, February 27
<br>
The pharmaceutical industry and life sciences in general have begun to depend on in silico experiments as critical elements in the path to discovery. This has enabled exploration that is only limited by their ability to access sufficient computing resources and to store and manage the resultant mountain of data. Presentations and case studies from those that have turned to Grid-based solutions to meet these needs will be featured in this half day workshop.

Data Management Workshop - Thursday, February 28
<br>
This full day workshop, co-hosted by OGF and the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA), will address data management challenges with a focus on file system and data movement.  We will also explore potential synergies and common areas between OGF and SNIA.

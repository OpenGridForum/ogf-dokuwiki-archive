Steven Newhouse, Co-Chair, HPC Basic Profile Working Group  
<br>
<br>
SuperComputing 2007 in Reno saw the second 'interoperability fest' involving the OGF's HPC 
Basic Profile (HPCBP) specification. Groups from academia, research and industry came 
together to demonstrate the interoperability of the core specification and to prototype extensions 
to the core specification used to support more advanced capabilities - such as file staging. 
<br>
<br>
 
<strong>
High Performance Computing Basic Profile (HPCBP) Background 
</strong>
	    <br>
The HPCBP specification has been developed by the OGF's HPC Profile Working Group over 
the last 18 months to define how to submit, monitor and manage jobs using standard 
mechanisms across different job schedulers or Grid middleware from different software 
providers. A significant milestone was passed in August 2007 when the HPC Profile Working 
Group's first specification - the HPC Basic Profile 1.0 - was published as a proposed 
recommendation. As part of the process of moving the HPCBP from a proposed to a full 
recommendation it is necessary to gather experiences of implementing the specification, and to 
demonstrate its interoperability between two or more independent implementations. The 
working group, comprising individuals from industry, academia and research, decided to use 
SuperComputing 2007 as the venue for an 'interoperability fest' of the published specifications. 
The HPCBP is focused on just managing job submission yet it provides sufficient core 
functionality to enable it use as a basis for integration into applications (both desktop and web 
based), its use as a basis for meta-scheduling and from within workflow engines. It leverages 
standards developed within the OGF (the Basic Execution Service and the Job Submission 
Description Language specification) and those from the broader web services community (WS- 
Security, WSDL and SOAP). 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
At SC06 last year over a dozen groups drawn from industry, academia and research 
demonstrated interoperability between their prototype implementations of this web service on 
their existing job submission infrastructures. This year, with the HPCBP specification now a 
proposed OGF standards recommendation, many of these groups returned to show how the 
longer-term integration of the HPCBP into their plans were proceeding. Several commercial 
organizations were using prototypes developed by their engineering teams as part of their plans 
for inclusion in their products. Teams from academia and research were showing how their 
implementations could be deployed and used with large scale Gird infrastructure deployments. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
 
<strong>
SuperComputing 2007 Demonstration Results 
</strong>
	    <br>
Participants in this year's activity included Altair Engineering, Inc, Microsoft, Platform 
Computing, the London e-Science Centre at Imperial College London on behalf of OMII-UK, the 
University of Virginia e-Science group, and representatives from the EGEE and NIC/FZJ groups 
within the OMII-Europe project. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
All of the participants were demonstrating their implementations of the HPCBP, revised from last 
year's versions due to the final changes made in the specification during the public comment 
period, and verifying their continued interoperability with other participating implementations. 
This interoperability work had been greatly accelerated through the use of a web based 
compatibility tester developed by the University of Virginia e-Science group. The portal allows 
users to run a series of tests, derived from the HPCBP specification, to verify that their endpoint 
is compliant with the standard by seeing how it accepts and generates the XML messages, and 
responds to failures or incorrect messages.
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
From this ground work, the interoperability testing that took place in the run-up to SC07 and at 
the meeting was broadly very successful. Jobs were passing from clients to services located on 
different operating systems (e.g. different versions of Linux and Windows), using different web 
service stacks (including Windows Communication Foundation, gSOAP, Axis, XFire) and 
interfacing to different jobs scheduling interfaces (including PBS, LSF,  Windows Compute 
Cluster Server v1 & v2, SGE, Torque, ARC, CREAM and Globus). Minor issues continue to be 
found relating to the interoperability of different web service hosting environments, (e.g. in how 
WS-Security is handled) rather than any fundamental problems with the HPCBP specification.
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
Commercial Adoption Plans 
</strong>
	    <br>
Several commercial organizations also announced their plans to provide implementations of the 
HPCBP compatible web services in their products. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
Platform Computing have contributed their implementation to an open source project (BES++ 
hosted on SourceForge) that uses the gSOAP toolkit to submit jobs through the HPCBP into 
LSF. Work is ongoing at the University of Virginia to extend this software to submit jobs into 
other schedulers, such as PBS. This software will be integrated as part of Platform's product 
line in 2008. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
Microsoft were demonstrating a prototype of an HPCBP compatible web service running on 
Windows HPC Server 2008 - the next version of Microsoft's HPC product due out in the second 
half of 2008. It uses the Windows Communication Foundation as its web service stack and it is 
currently planned for inclusion in the second beta of HPC Server 2008 due out in Spring 2008. 
Altair Engineering also had a prototype integration of an HPCBP compatible client in their PBS 
product that demonstrated the use of this specification as a meta-scheduler. Job submitted into 
PBS using the conventional command line utilities could be transferred to another HPCBP 
compliant resource. At SC07 jobs were being submitted into a PBS instance running on Linux 
on the Altair stand and being executed through the HPCBP web service on a Windows machine 
on the Microsoft stand.
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
Next Steps 
</strong>
	    <br>
After SC07 work is continuing within the working group to capture our interoperability 
experiences in order to support the migration of the HPCBP specification from a proposed to a 
full recommendation. These experiences are also being used to refine those implementations 
that will be emerging in 2008 as products. The practical experience gained at SC07 with the 
Data Staging and Activity Credential extensions will be used to develop a single extension 
focused exclusively on integrating File Staging operations that need different credentials with 
the current JSDL specification already used in the HPCBP. It is hoped that this specification will 
be submitted into the OGF process in early 2008.

Q&A with Morris Riedel, GIN CG Secretary 
	    <br>
	    <br>
<strong>
What is GIN (and is there 'WHISKY' too)? 
</strong>
	    <br>
Many Grid projects have begun to offer production services to end-users during the past several 
years with an increasing number of application projects that require access to a wide variety of 
resources and services in multiple Grids. Therefore, the purpose of the Grid Interoperation Now 
(GIN) Community Group is to organize, manage and demonstrate a set of interoperation efforts 
among production Grid projects and e-Science infrastructures using computational or storage- 
related resources in more than one production Grid.  The GIN group defines interoperation as 
what needs to be done to get production Grids to work together as a fast short-term 
achievement using as much existing technologies and workarounds as available today. Hence, 
this is not the perfect solution and different than interoperability that is defined as the native 
ability of Grids and Grid technologies to interact directly via common open standards in the near 
future. In other words, GIN demonstrates where standards are still missing in production Grids 
and provides lessons learned out of production Grids if standards have to be improved towards 
production usage. And sorry to say, but to the best of my knowledge there is no WHISKY group, 
but there was once a BOF for it. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
Is GIN only focusing on job submission in cross-Grid scenarios? 
</strong>
<br>
In one word, No! Our interoperation efforts of production Grids typically involve a lot of different 
integrated components out of different technology areas like information, security or data. That's 
why GIN implements interoperation in specific areas. First, authorization and identity 
management (GIN-AUTH) deals with resource sharing among members of the GIN Virtual 
Organization (VO). Second, the data management and movement (GIN-DATA) area is working 
on the interoperation of different data management technologies currently in use of multiple e- 
Science infrastructures. These include the Storage Resource Broker (SRB), Storage Resource 
Managers (SRM) and GridFTP. Third, the job description and submission (GIN-JOBS) area 
focuses on job management across different Grid technologies and middlewares used in 
production. Another important area is the information services and schema (GIN-INFO) area, 
because the efforts conducted in this area basically provide the base for cross-Grid 
interoperation taking up-to-date information into account. These interoperations rely on 
information models such as Common Information Model (CIM) and Grid Laboratory Uniform 
Environment (GLUE) or information systems such as Berkeley Database Information Index 
(BDII) and Monitoring and Discovery Services (MDS). Finally, the operations experience of pilot 
test applications (GIN-OPS) for cross-Grid operations works on different applications that 
require resources from multiple Grid infrastructures. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
Tell us about what the GIN team just accomplished at SC07 
</strong>
The idea of having interoperation demonstrations at the SC conferences is not something new 
and GIN presented a couple of interoperation demonstrations already at SC06 as one of its 
milestones. In a similar manner as last year, the GIN group again organized a set of 
demonstrations that have been announced through several channels. Finally, we ended up 
having about 9 different interoperation demonstrations that have been shown at booths at SC07 
that either did daily demonstrations (e.g. Enabling Grids for e-Science, Hungarian Grid, 
NorduGrid Collaboration booths) or a dedicated Grid day (e.g. John von Neumann Institute for 
Computing booth) that include some of the demonstrations. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
In more detail, members of the group presented 'Storage Resource Broker (SRB) and Storage 
Resource Manager (SRM) Island interoperability', including the transfer of files between an 
SRM and an SRB using OGF's GridFTP specification as the file transfer protocol. Another 
demonstration related to data was the 'WS-DAIR interface for the gLite AMGA Metadata 
Catalogue'. The gLite-AMGA metadata catalogue, developed within the EGEE project, provides 
access to relational data on the Grid and is widely used in the scientific Grid community. The 
demonstration presented interoperation by implementation of a WS-DAIR compatible interface 
in AMGA. Another interesting demonstration was the 'information system interoperation'. An 
attempt was made to translate information from all the existing production Grid infrastructures in 
order to populate a single information resource. The resource chosen was a Berkeley Database 
Information Index (BDII) and the common format used was the Glue Schema version 1.2. The 
result is a BDII that contains information from 9 production Grid infrastructures (EGEE, OSG, 
NDGF, Naregi, Teragrid, Pragma, DEISA, NGS, APAC). This information was used to show the 
location of the computing centres in Google Earth and the current Grid landscape for the 
production Grids.
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
There were also demonstrations that underlined how the standard landscape of OGF is 
evolving in production Grids. In the 'UNICORE and gLite Interoperation' demonstration, the 
interoperation of the gLite (European EGEE Grid) and UNICORE 5 (European DEISA Grid) 
production Grid middleware using proprietary protocols motivates the usage of standards from 
OGF in future. In this demonstration, users build a job on the gLite User Interface and submit it 
through the gLite Workload Manager to an interoperation Computing Element that forwards jobs 
to the UNICORE Grid for their execution on supercomputers. We see here a clear demand of a 
an open standard like the OGSA-Basic Execution Services (BES) that could be used in cross- 
Grid job submission scenarios if both middleware would use it in future. Therefore, the 'VOMS- 
enabled and OGSA-BES-based job submits between UNICORE and gLite' demonstration 
showed the evolution of the above mentioned demonstration for future usage in the production 
Grids using emerging open standards from OGF and OASIS. The UNICORE 6 BES and 
CREAM-BES of gLite are both OGF OGSA-BES-compliant services developed in OMII-Europe. 
However, lessons learned from GIN indicate that job submission standards alone are not 
enough for interoperation and security is also a major important point of it. Therefore, we used 
the new SAML-compliant Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS) of OMII-Europe as 
security setup. All in all, the demonstration showed one client that is able to submit jobs to both 
of these Grid middleware systems without changing the security setup or the job description 
language. This was not possible before and is a real success story coming out of OMII-Europe. 
Hence, there are components from OMII-Europe that provide technical interoperability between 
EGEE (through gLite) and DEISA (through UNICORE 6) in the near future. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
End-users at SC2007 have seen the 'GIN portals' demonstration in action based on P-Grade. 
P-GRADE Portal (Parallel Grid Run-time and Application Development Environment) is a 
service rich graphical environment for the development, execution and monitoring of data-driven 
Grid applications. The P-GRADE Portal is used by users and application developers of several 
national (UK NGS, HunGrid, Turkish Grid, etc.) and international Grid based virtual 
organizations (EGEE, SEE-GRID, etc.). The demonstration included most important features 
and typical use cases of the environment as well as other outcomes of the developer alliance 
which is behind the P-GRADE Portal efforts. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
Another demonstration showed the emerging interoperability between the accounting systems 
DGAS and SGAS achieved by the OMII-Europe project. DGAS is the accounting system of 
gLite used within EGEE and is currently augmented with an OGF OGSA - Resource Usage 
Service (RUS) compliant interface. SGAS is the accounting system of the Swedish Grid and 
Globus Toolkits (Tech Preview) and is also currently augmented with an emerging OGF OGSA- 
Resource Usage Service (RUS) interface. Here we demonstrated the exchange of accounting 
information by using an SGAS client that is used to extract usage records compliant with the 
OGF Usage Record Format (URF) standard from a DGAS server. Aligned with this 
demonstration we have shown an OGSA-RUS interface in UNICORE that uses the URF 
information for resource-level monitoring in an interoperable application called LLView that 
could leverage URFs via OGSA-RUS interfaces also from other systems such as DGAS or 
SGAS. We in GIN think that accounting and billing will get more important in the next years in 
the production Grid infrastructures, especially in cross-Grid scenarios. That's why we have been 
interested in demonstrations in this rather new area of GIN.
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
An interesting scientific interoperation scenario was shown in the 'DEISA and Australian Grid 
Interoperation' demonstration. This demonstration showed the processing of a small workflow 
employing the NAMD molecular dynamics suite. Several DEISA sites participated and specific 
jobs have been formulated using OGF's JSDL specification. Within the workflow a number of 
compute intensive jobs have been submitted to DEISA sites with the help of the DESHL 
UNICORE command line interface that uses the OGF SAGA standard. At the same time a 
similar number of jobs have been submitted via GRAM to the AU Grid and executed primarily at 
Monash. Output from the Australian jobs will be moved to the DEISA GPFS filesystem via 
OGF's GridFTP and post-processed later. In another demonstration, a subset of the GridFTP2 
protocol has been shown as implementation in dCache, Globus C, and Java client libraries. 
They are already used within production Grids and a demonstration was shown by the NDGF. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
So, it seems that several major milestones for the group were accomplished at SC07 
</strong>
	    <br>
Yes, the interoperation demonstrations at the SC conferences are a highlight for the group itself 
showing short-term interoperation achievements or emerging standards that are mature enough 
to be considered for production usage within production Grids in the near-future (e.g. OGSA- 
BES, URF). However, the GIN community group always tries to transfer experience from 
production Grids into the standardization process in OGF and this is a good opportunity for 
OGF groups to gain lessons learned or even to collect specific standard requirements from real 
life interoperations in production Grids. For instance, at OGF 21 in Seattle, we organized a 
'Software providers meet GIN and Standards' session that also brought together the people for 
discussions having different viewpoints. According to the feedback we got from participants, this 
session was very interesting and thus the interoperation demonstrations at SC07 are important 
milestones but not the only ones we have in mind. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
What are the top 3 things the team learned from the SC07 demonstrations? 
</strong>
	    <br>
[1] That open standards have to evolve faster and must take into account the experience from 
real production Grids and also the feedback from developers that implement the standards in 
the software provider stacks that are finally used on these infrastructures. Hence, the 
implementation of the standard should not start after standardization but during standardization 
to prove that the standard can be actually used later within production Grids and their 
production Grid middleware.  
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
[2] It makes no sense if numerous projects develop interoperability components via the 
integration of common open standards and they are not used in the production Grids 
afterwards. Hence, projects that adopt and implement the open standards from OGF in 
components of Grid middleware must try to get their implementations back into the major 
oftware provider stacks that are deployed on these large production Grid infrastructures. s 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
[3] Focus on spin-off activities that deal with particular requirements. For instance, 
investigations during the SC06 and SC07 demonstrations showed that an achievement of 
interoperability in terms of information of production Grids requires an agreement on the 
information content and schema. As a result, the Glue Schema activity is now an OGF working 
group and is defining this common schema for Grid computing. There are also other specific 
requirements that need more focus or a spin-off activity like the worker node profile or dedicated 
security setups to be used with specific standards, for instance a common way of passing 
credentials through an OGSA-BES-based job submission for third party data staging. 
 
	    <br>
	    <br>
<strong>
What are your plans as a result of the interop? 
</strong>
	    <br>
There were many lessons learned and we will write them down as experience documents, 
which will also include lessons learned and approaches from the SC06 demonstrations. Also, at 
OGF22 we will host a SC07 debriefing session offering discussions with other OGF participants 
about how OGF standards can be used in production Grids and which standards production 
Grid software providers should integrate as soon as possible to get more sustainability in 
interoperation efforts of production Grids. Real interoperability scenarios requiring resources in 
multiple Grids are actually appearing more and more and thus the interoperability in production 
Grids must be more widespread than our several interoperation demonstrations. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<strong>
Anything else you would like to add? 
</strong>
	    <br>
I would just like to personally thank all members of the OGF GIN group that have worked on the 
numerous demonstrators in the past several months.  Also, thanks to all those national and 
international funding bodies that supported the numerous projects world-wide so that their 
members are able to participate within GIN. Finalus with flyers and announcements at SC07.

OGF Specification Adoption 
</i> 
	    <br>
Two weeks ago at SC07, OGF demonstrated interoperability of 12 OGF specifications and 
announced the implementation of the HPC Basic Profile in products being planned by Microsoft, 
Altair Engineering and Platform Computing. These significant accomplishments show how the 
work of OGF is being recognized as key to further adoption of grid technology.  This multi- 
session track will build on the SC07 momentum by featuring contributions from developers and 
users showcasing their work implementing OGF specifications.

<i> 
Pharma/Life Sciences 
</i> 
	    <br>
The pharmaceutical industry and life sciences in general have begun to depend on in silico 
experiments as critical elements in the path to discovery. This has enabled exploration that is 
only limited by their ability to access sufficient computing resources and to store and manage 
the resultant mountain of data. Presentations and case studies from those that have turned to 
Grid-based solutions to meet these needs are being solicited. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
 
<i> 
Financial Services 
</i> 
	    <br>
The financial services industry is one of the early adopters, and successful users, of Grid 
technology.  As the technology matures, new (and old) issues emerge like expanding grids to 
support transactional workloads, data management and movement, and putting policies in place 
for charging and tracking usage.  We seek presentations and case studies that describe the 
emerging issues the financial services industry is now facing in Grid. Registration

			Globecom07 Report

	      <br>
Craig Lee, OGF President 
	      <br>
	      <br>
OGF hosted the "Grids and Service-Oriented Networks Panel" at Globecom 2007 on November 
27.  This panel explored where grids could support the emerging concept of service-oriented 
networks, i.e., networks that are used and managed as a set of services.  The panelists were 
John Wittgreffe (ICT Research Chief, BT Group Chief Technology Office) Inder Monga (Director, 
CTO Labs, Nortel), and Gigi Karmous-Edwards (Principal Scientist, MCNC). A common theme 
from this session was that web/grid standards, Web 2.0, virtualization, and the convergence of 
digital media and appliances all point towards the notion of a "soft telco" -- that is to say, 
Service-Oriented Networks.  BT's Web21C, for example, is a web services and software 
development kit with the goal of hiding complexity and making it easy for end-users to "mash- 
up" their systems.  The real trick, though, is how to flexibly implement this in a wide-area, 
distributed environment.  The contextualization of virtual machines may play a key role here in 
transparently managing complexity.  There is clearly a need for a service-oriented network 
reference model wherein things like hierarchical SLAs can be composed to achieve desired 
end-user behaviors.  Dynamic provisioning, advance co-reservations, and managing compute 
data affinity is also important. Follow-up work is being discussed for reference models and VM 
management.

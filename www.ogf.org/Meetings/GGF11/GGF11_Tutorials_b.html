      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: A key factor to the adoption 
        of Grid infrastructure is the ability to actually get work done using 
        the Grid. Thus, making sure that applications can effectively take advantage 
        of the Grid infrastructure is a number one requirement of Grid deployment. 
        This tutorial will describe a process for determining which applications 
        can be Grid enabled and techniques for integrating the application into 
        the Grid. Issues such as data management, license management, and application 
        suitability will be covered using case studies representing the current 
        state of the art. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: Application developers, application 
        architects, grid developers, grid architects. Attendees should be familiar 
        with application development process, and understand requirements for 
        distributed application execution. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Level of Tutorial: 25% Introductory, 25% Intermediate, 
        and 50% Advanced.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tutorial Speakers:Dr. Rajkumar Buyya, The 
        University of Melbourne, Australia, </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dr. 
        Kurt Stockinger<br>
        Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Intended Audience: This tutorial should 
        be of interest to a large number of GGF/HPDC participants from academia, 
        government, and commercial organizations as it focuses on both theory 
        and practice of Grid Economy. They include:(A) students, researchers, 
        and developers interested in creating technologies and applications for 
        Next Generation Grids with focus on Grid economy, (B) GGF/HPDC participants 
        from commercial organizations interested in creating online Grid marketplace, 
        and (C) users of Grid Computing as we will be offering a live demonstration 
        of current Grid Economy-based technologies and their applications during 
        the tutorial.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Background: We expect participants to have 
        knowledge of Grid computing at the introductory level. A familiarity of 
        low-level Grid middleware such as Globus Toolkit will be an advantage.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Extended Abstract: Grids aim at exploiting 
        synergies that result from cooperation of autonomous distributed entities. 
        The synergies that result from Grid cooperation include the sharing, exchange, 
        selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed resources (such 
        as computers, data bases, scientific instruments) for solving large-scale 
        problems in science, engineering, and commerce. For this cooperation to 
        be sustainable, participants need to have (economic) incentive. Therefore, 
        “incentive” mechanisms should be considered as one of key design parameters 
        of Grid architectures.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Grid community has embraced the integration 
        of commodity Web services and Grid technologies that led to the development 
        of Grid services. The widespread interested in Grid computing from commercial 
        organisations in recent times is pushing Grid computing towards mainstream 
        computing and Grid services to become valuable economic commodities.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of a number of advances in Grid 
        computing, resource management and scheduling in such environments continues 
        to be a challenging and complex undertaking. The geographic distribution 
        of resources owned by different organizations with different usage policies, 
        cost models and varying load and availability patterns is problematic. 
        The Grid service providers (resource owners) and Grid service consumers 
        (resource users) have different goals, objectives, strategies, and requirements. 
        To address these resource management challenges, a distributed computational 
        economy has been recognized as an effective metaphor for the management 
        of Grid resources as it: (1) enables the regulation of supply and demand 
        for resources, (2) provides economic incentive for Grid service providers, 
        and (3) motives the Grid service consumers to trade-off between deadline, 
        budget, and the required level of quality-of-service. These factors also 
        promote Grid services to become valuable economic commodities.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial introduces fundamental principles 
        of Grid computing and computational economy and discusses how they impact 
        on emerging Computational and Data Grid technologies. It identifies resource 
        management challenges and presents a Grid Architecture for Computational 
        Economies that can be realized by leveraging existing technologies. It 
        then introduces new challenges and requirements introduced by the Grid 
        Economy on Grid Service Providers (GSPs) and Grid Service Consumers. We 
        present solutions to these challenges based on our experience in designing 
        and developing computational and Data Grid technologies such as Nimrod-G, 
        Gridbus, GridSim, and OptorSim.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We introduce (a) Grid Market Directory 
        that allow GSPs to publish their resources and GSC to discover service 
        providers, (b) different Grid economy models for resource management, 
        (c) Grid Bank that provides Grid accounting, authorization, and payment 
        services, (d) Grid Broker that allows users to lease Grid services at 
        runtime based on their price and users’ QoS requirements such as the deadline 
        and budget. We present a number of Grid economy based scheduling algorithms 
        for compute and data intensive applications on Global Grids.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We demonstrate effectiveness of Grid economy in resource 
        management by deploying applications such as molecular docking and high 
        energy physics on our experimental Grid testbed having resources located 
        in different organisations around the world. We also demonstrate how one 
        can make trade-off QoS requirements such as the deadline and budget.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The last part of the tutorial is dedicated 
        to OptorSim, a Grid simulator for studying scheduling and replica optimisation 
        strategies. OptorSim uses an auction model with a Peer-to-Peer infrastructure 
        for buying and selling files on the Grid. We will discuss the design and 
        implementation of OptorSim and evaluate the performance for various data 
        intensive jobs that are typical for large scientific analysis studies. 
        Results show that the economic algorithms better utilize computational, 
        storage and network resources than traditional algorithms.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We conclude the tutorial by (a) identifying 
        a number of open research topics in Grid computing with a focus on Grid 
        Economy, (b) discussing our thoughts on new opportunities for commercial 
        companies to develop a new Grid technologies/products that help in the 
        realization Grid Exchanges and online Grid marketplaces, and (c) highlighting 
        sociological and intellectual implications of this new Grid paradigm and 
        its impact on the computing marketplace.</font></p>

        University of Virginia</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: Web services have become an important 
        component of distributed computing applications over the internet. The 
        merging of grid and web services has lead to the Web Services Resource 
        Framework (WSRF), a series of specifications for performing grid computing 
        on top of web services. WSRF.NET is a project at the University of Virginia 
        that allows the creation of WSRF-compliant web services using the Microsoft 
        .NET platform. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial will provide an overview 
        of important concepts in WSRF, as well as .NET. We will discuss the relationship 
        between the WSRF specifications and current Microsoft technology and the 
        means by which WSRF is rendered on .NET. The WSRF.NET architecture will 
        be described and its programming model explained. We will then cover the 
        process of building services in WSRF.NET via a hands-on lab for directly 
        experimenting with the software. Participants will learn about the WSRF.NET 
        system and how to use it to write WSRF-compliant services and clients. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: Attendees interested in WSRF 
        on .NET, building grid services on .NET, and/or inter-operability between 
        .NET and non-.NET systems. Familiarity with both WSRF and .NET is helpful 
        (as we will not be covering .NET concepts beyond those needed to write 
        services in WSRF.NET), but are not required. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: While the Globus Toolkit from 
        the Globus Alliance can make Grid projects and products significantly 
        easier, the challenges themselves are far from easy and the Globus Toolkit 
        does not provide a turnkey solution. Success in a Grid project depends 
        on a clear vision of the problems that need to be solved, awareness of 
        existing technologies that can contribute to the solutions (both within 
        and beyond the Globus Toolkit), and a strategy for using the technology 
        to overcome the challenge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial provides answers to critical 
        questions for Grid project planners and product developers and how the 
        Globus Toolkit fits into a Grid project or product strategy. The Globus

        the implementation of scheduling plug ins and the addition of adapters 
        to new resource managers. The issues one can expect to encounter when 
        deploying CSF will also be examined.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: Developers, system administrators,

        </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract; This tutorial will review 
        object-oriented modeling and UML, and introduce the Distributed Management 
        Task Force (DMTF) Common Information Model (CIM) to the GGF membership. 
        The DMTF represents most of the major, and many minor, computer and peripheral 
        vendors, as well as management software vendors. The Common Information 
        Model ships now, or will soon, on many platforms of interest to the Grid 
        community. It thus provides a standard means to do resource discovery 
        and management.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This all-day tutorial will present an overview 
        of DMTF Working Groups and processes, discuss modeling and what is encoded, 
        why, and how; introduce the CIM architecture, and demonstrate the communication 
        of CIM data using HTTP (WBEM) and Web Services. It will also present the 
        architecture of the forthcoming CIM V3, which is XMI-based and will eventually 
        provide WSRF-based communication.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: The intended audience is GGF 
        working groups membership who could leverage the CIM development in writing 
        GGF specifications and standards and propose modifications to CIM necessary 
        for grid compatibility.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The attendees will learn the significance 
        of CIM, why it is so very important to the grid community,<br>
        how it is coded and why it is as important to GGF as is the overall architecture 
        (OGSA) and the overall infrastructure (OGSI). It is a third, supporting 
        framework.</font></p>

        Abstract: The UK based Open Grid Service Architecture - Data Access and 
        Integration<br>
        (OGSA-DAI) project has been producing middleware components required to 
        access and integrate data in a Grid environment. Our goal is that Grid 
        data services will provide the ability to discover, manage, and access 
        data resources within an OGSA compliant architecture.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The OGSA-DAI software supports access to 
        data in relational databases (MySQL, DB2 and Oracle), and data in XML 
        repositories (Xindice), and will soon start supporting other data resource 
        types. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial provides an introduction 
        to the functional capabilities of Grid data services and the design of 
        the OGSA-DAI architectural framework. The tutorial uses worked examples 
        of Grid data services based on the current OGSA-DAI release, with hands 
        on tutorials which guide attendees through the stages in creating applications 
        to access Grid data services.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: Scientific application developers, 
        those interested in accessing data from different data resources. Attendees 
        must have a basic understanding of Java, XML and Grid concepts and must 
        have a laptop with relevant software installed to participate. For more 
        details, visit the project website: &lt;http://www.ogsadai.org.ukhttp://www.ogsadai.org.uk</font></p>

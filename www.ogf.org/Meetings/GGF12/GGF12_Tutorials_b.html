      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: Cadence Design Systems gridMatrix 
        Grid Initiative</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cadence Design Systems has embraced grid 
        technologies, and has dedicated itself to integrating grids into every 
        aspect of their production environment. The Cadence Server Farm Initiative 
        (SFI) has helped reduce development time and costs, both internal and 
        external to Cadence, by integrating grids into their software development 
        and chip design workflow processes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The key grid infrastructure that Cadence 
        developed is called gridMatrix, which allows different organizations to 
        submit workflows seamlessly into the grid. The gridMatrix solution in 
        conjunction with LSF, Sun GridEngine, Condor, common support tools, and 
        standardized deployment practices have turned an integration that initially 
        was not universally embraced into a much anticipated initiative. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cadence has taken a four-pronged approach 
        to deploying a successful grid infrastructure throughout their organization: 
        Standardized Hardware, Common Tools, gridMatrix Infrastructure, and Training. 
        This tutorial will discuss the lessons learned from deploying to over 
        50 organizations, 17 locations, and over 3000 users around the world.

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: Life-saving research is a core 
        competency at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 
        (NIEHS) based in the United States. NIEHS encountered a dilemma where 
        data volumes continued to grow at an exponential rate while IT resources 
        remained limited. Scientists and researchers developed a unique solution 
        that embraces data mining and grid computing to enhance groundbreaking 
        research and data analysis into the environmental causes of cancer. This 
        tutorial shares NIEHS' experience in using a compute grid to distribute 
        the processing of data and dramatically reduce the elapsed time necessary 
        to analyze the results.<br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: The deployment of a grid enabled 
        environment requires detailed attention and several layers of infrastructure 
        to make an environment easily accessible, usable, productive, intuitive, 
        and supportable. This tutorial is a case study of the grid enabled environment, 
        DesignSphere, which was developedand deployed at Synopsys for 5000 engineers 
        and 15,000 CPU's worldwide. Synopsys has developed a RIDGE framework that 
        enables Remote access, business Intelligence, Data center planning, Grid 
        enabled queuing systems, and Environment shaping. The modular components 
        of RIDGE will be discussed in detail as a case study of what is deployed 
        at the enterprise level production system at Synopsys and the operational 
        efficiency that has been achieved by Synopsys by their use. A detailed 
        financial model that illustrates the operational efficiencies and the 
        improved efficiency of the computational resources, R&amp;D teams, and 
        those of IT will also be discussed.<br>
        Audience: IT directors, IT architects, IT administrators, application 
        developers, grid developers, CAD administrators. Attendees should be familiar 
        with enterprise level implementation and infrastructure requirements required 
        for various technologies.<br>
        The attendees should learn about real life implementation of various technologies, 
        what work, what Synopsys has determined to be successful and what pieces 
        of a grid enabled environment are still lacking. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instructors: Marty Humphrey and Glenn Wasson, 
        University of Virginia</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: Web services have become an important 
        component of distributed computing applications over the internet. The 
        merging of grid and web services has lead to the Web Services Resource 
        Framework (WSRF), a series of specifications for performing grid computing 
        on top of web services. WSRF.NET is a project at the University of Virginia 
        that allows the creation of WSRF-compliant web services using the Microsoft 
        .NET platform. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial will provide an overview of important 
        concepts in WSRF, as well as .NET. We will discuss the relationship between 
        the WSRF specifications and current Microsoft technology and the means 
        by which WSRF is rendered on .NET. The WSRF.NET architecture will be described 
        and its programming model explained. We will then cover the process of 
        building services in WSRF.NET via a hands-on lab for directly experimenting 
        with the software. Participants will learn about the WSRF.NET system and 
        how to use it to write WSRF-compliant services and clients. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: Attendees interested in WSRF 
        on .NET, building grid services on .NET, and/or inter-operability between 
        .NET and non-.NET systems. Familiarity with both WSRF and .NET is helpful 
        (as we will not be covering .NET concepts beyond those needed to write 
        services in WSRF.NET), but are not required. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instructor: Lee Liming, Argonne National 
        Laboratory</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract: While the Globus Toolkit from 
        the Globus Alliance can make Grid projects and products significantly 
        easier, the challenges themselves are far from easy and the Globus Toolkit 
        does not provide a turnkey solution. Success in a Grid project depends 
        on a clear vision of the problems that need to be solved, awareness of 
        existing technologies that can contribute to the solutions (both within 
        and beyond the Globus Toolkit), and a strategy for using the technology 
        to overcome the challenge.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial provides answers to critical 
        questions for Grid project planners and product developers and how the 
        Globus Toolkit fits into a Grid project or product strategy. The Globus 
        Toolkit will be put into context, and examples and roadmaps for the most 
        common uses of the Globus Toolkit will be provided.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience: IT executives and managers, Project 
        leaders, researchers, scientists, and developers. Attendees will gain 
        a deeper understanding of how the Grid and the Globus Toolkit fit within 
        their plans for producinguseful products and/or applications and for planning 
        successful Grid projects.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Attendees should be familiar with the basic

        -------------------<br>
        The Semantic Grid is an extension of the current Grid in which information 
        and services are given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers 
        and people to work in cooperation. Many researchers recognize that the 
        vision of the Grid as &quot;coordinated resource sharing and problem solving 
        in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations&quot; is closely 
        related to that of the Semantic Web - which is also, fundamentally, about 
        joining things up. Applying Semantic Web technologies to the information 
        and knowledge in Grid applications is enticing. The new service-oriented 
        Grid (OGSA) tallies up with efforts to work on Semantic Web Services where 
        semantic technologies work with and for service-based Grid middleware. 
        Semantic Web technologies would not only useful managing the knowledge 
        resources of the applications /using/ the Grid, but also /within/ it. 
        In this half day tutorial we will present:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. a definition of the Semantic Grid, drawing 
        a distinction with the Knowledge Grid <br>
        2. introduction to the latest relevant developments in the Semantic Web 
        technologies.<br>
        3. survey of recent examples of semantic grid early adopters and their 
        experiences<br>
        4. prospects for the future, including pointers to recent developments 
        in the EU FP6 </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abstract:<br>
        The Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) provides application 
        developers and distributed resource management builders with a programming 
        model that enables the development of distributed applications tightly 
        coupled to an underlying distributed resource management system (DRMS). 
        For deployers of such distributedapplications, DRMAA preserves flexibility 
        and choice in system design.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This tutorial begins with an overview of 
        distributed and parallel processing approaches, and introduces DRMAA as 
        a common API to address the distributed application execution needs of 
        parallel application developers, system administrators, and end users. 
        The DRMAA programming interface and job attributes will be detailed, as 
        well as modes of parallel execution. DRMAA API groups will be discussed 
        in detail, <br>
        including job specification, job submission, job monitoring and control, 
        error structure, and auxiliary routines.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Existing SGE and Condor implementations 
        as well as the use of the Perl DRMAAc bindings will be demonstrated. A 
        proof-of-concept implementation for the distributed rendering of POVRAY 
        jobs will be developed during the tutorial.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Future directions of DRMAA will also be 
        discussed, including Web Services interface, collaboration with JSDL-WG, 
        requirements for GRAAP job agreements, etc.</font><br>

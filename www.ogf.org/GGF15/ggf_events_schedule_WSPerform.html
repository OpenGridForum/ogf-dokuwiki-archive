            <p class="body">Abstract: <br>
              The convergence of Web services with Grid computing has brought 
              significant benefits. Lingering performance concerns of Web services, 
              however, threaten to slow the adoption of Grid services, and limit 
              its penetration into the cyberinfrastructure. Research avenues that 
              may contribute to addressing the performance issue include advanced 
              parsing techniques, alternative binary encodings of XML, and streaming 
              XML processors to address memory usage. This half-day workshop seeks 
              to foster discussion of these issues by bringing together researchers 
              and application developers, and also to discuss metaquestions such 
              as whether or not performance concerns are valid, and if so, what 
              is the impact. </p>
            <p class="body">Synopsis: <br>
              The convergence of service-oriented computing and Grid computing 
              has led to the wide acceptance of Web services as the standard communication 
              mechanism in Grid computing. This has brought the benefits of improved 
              interoperability in heterogeneous environments, and has allowed 
              Grid computing researchers and developers to leverage the substantial 
              efforts of the wider Web services community.</p>
            <p class="body">Performance, however, has been a lingering concern 
              of Web services. Common implementations of Web services have developed 
              reputations, deserved or not, for being slow and memory-intensive; 
              or in some cases simply unable to handle large messages. Secure 
              web services must also contend with XML canonicalization, XPath 
              query computations, and cryptographic computations. The performance 
              issues have been attributed variously to underlying causes such 
              as the inherent verbosity of<br>
              XML, the costs of converting floating-point numbers from the native 
              machine representation to a text format, and the proliferation of 
              DOM-based trees in XML processing streams.</p>
            <p class="body">The perceived inefficiences have slowed the adoption 
              of Web services, and limited its use to communications deemed not 
              performance-sensitive. Performance sensitive data and communications 
              are then conveyed using mechanisms, often ad hoc, proprietary, or 
              binary-based, that are considered more efficient. This has two disadvantages. 
              First, it prevents the benefits of Web services from penetrating 
              deeply into the information infrastructure. For example, semantic 
              mediation is a technique which can be used to address data compatibility 
              issues, but works best with XML-based data. Data format description 
              languages can be used to reconcile semantic mediation with arbitrary 
              data formats, but introduces another layer of complexity.</p>
            <p class="body">Second, it prevents a single, standard data model 
              and terminology from being adopted throughout. One set of concepts 
              and models is required for Web services, and another is required 
              for the high-performance technologies. For example, binary attachments 
              can be used in SOAP to convey scientific data, but that scientific 
              data then requires understanding another type system to interpret 
              the contents. If Web services were efficient enough, sending the 
              data directly in the Web service as XML may simplify the overall 
              architecture and improve the interoperability of scientific data. 
              These issues are increasingly important as we seek to improve scientific 
              data management, provenance, and compatibility issues.</p>
            <p class="body">A number of different avenues of research may contribute 
              to addressing Web services performance. Improved XML parsing may 
              alleviate some bottlenecks. Streaming approaches may address other 
              issues, such as memory footprint. Benchmark suites might help focus 
              research and separate myths from reality. Alternate binary encodings 
              of XML may address XML verbosity and numeric<br>
              conversion issues.</p>
            <p class="body">Goals of Session<br>
              ----------------</p>
            <p class="body">The goal of this session is to foster discussion on 
              these research directions, and metaquestions such as when Web services 
              performance is a problem, the impact of Web services performance 
              issues, and even whether or not Web services performance is an actual 
              problem. We hope to draw an audience consisting of researchers in 
              Web services performance, and application developers and architects 
              who are developing production Grid systems.</p>
            <p class="body">Target Audience<br>
              ---------------<br>
              The target audience for this workshop is architects, developers, 
              and engineers of production Grid systems; and researchers in Web 
              services performance. This includes the following communities:</p>
            <p class="body"> - researchers and developers in XML/Web services 
              performance, developers of parsing tools, XSLT/XPath performance 
              optimisers, and SOAP engines</p>
            <p class="body"> - researchers and application developers in Grid 
              computing, utility computing and on-demand computing, especially 
              those based on service-oriented software architecture and web service 
              technologies</p>
            <p class="body"> - engineers and developers from industries/businesses 
              who think about using Web services or have used Web services but 
              are concerned about performance or have experienced performance 
              problems</p>
            <p class="body"> - researchers and specialists in performance and 
              measurement who have studied performance issues in Web services 
              technologies</p>
            <p class="body">Potential Attendees<br>
              -------------------<br>
              XML performance: there is a very active industrial and academic 
              community of researchers and developers of XML performance tools 
              and optimisers, including organiser Y. Nakamura. This group of people 
              is a main target for participation, including people from IBM, Airbus, 
              smaller software companies, and academia such as Karlsruhe, INRIA, 
              University of Pennsylvania, etc.</p>
            <p class="body">Grid and other Web service application areas: the 
              Global Grid Forum and industries such as HP and IBM heavily push 
              service-oriented computing, but often have linger-ing doubts about 
              performance of the solutions. We expect interest from researchers 
              and developers of these cutting edge applications, including ondemand, 
              utility, en-terprise integration and business-to-business applications, 
              and organisor K. Chiu is closely involved with some specific application 
              areas in which low overhead is critical. Since the range of applications 
              is large, we target participants from various academic and industrial 
              organizations.</p>
            <p class="body">Workshop Format<br>
              ---------------<br>
              We are considering a 3-4 hour session consisting of about 6-8 invited 
              presentations divided into two categories. Each category would be 
              followed by a short panel discussion consisting of the presenters.</p>

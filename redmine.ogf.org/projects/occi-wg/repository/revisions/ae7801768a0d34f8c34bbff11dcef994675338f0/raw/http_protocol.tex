\section{Notational Conventions}
\input{include/notational}

The following terms \cite{rfc3986} are used when referring to URI
components:

\begin{verbatim}
 http://example.com:8080/over/there?action=stop#xyz
 \__/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \_/
  |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
\end{verbatim}

\section{OCCI RESTful HTTP Protocol}

This document specifies the OCCI HTTP Protocol, a RESTful protocol for
communication between OCCI server and OCCI client. The OCCI HTTP Protocol
support multiple different data formats as payload. Data formats are specified
an separate documents.

\section{Namespace}

The OCCI HTTP Protocol maps the OCCI Core model into the URL hierarchy by binding
\hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin} instances to unique URL paths. Such a URL path is called
the {\em location} of the \hl{Kind} or \hl{Mixin}.
A provider is free to choose the {\em location} as long as it is unique
within the service provider's URL namespace.
For example, the \hl{Kind} instance%
\footnote{\tt http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#compute}
for the \hl{Compute} type may be bound to {\tt /my/occi/api/compute/}.

Whenever a {\em location} is rendered it MUST be either a String or as
defined in RFC6570 \cite{rfc6570}.

A \hl{Kind} instance whose associated type cannot be instantiated MUST NOT be
bound to an URL path. This applies to the \hl{Kind} instance for OCCI Entity
which, according to OCCI Core, cannot be instantiated \cite{occi:core}.

\subsection{Bound and Unbound Paths}

Since a limited set of URL paths are bound to \hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin}
instances the URL hierarchy consists of both {\em bound} and {\em unbound}
paths.
A bound URL path is the {\em location} of a \hl{Kind} or \hl{Mixin} collection.

An unbound URL path MAY represent the union of all \hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin}
collection `below' the unbound path.

\section{Headers and Status Codes}

OCCI clients and Servers MUST include a minimum set of mandatory HTTP headers
in each request and response in order to be compliant.
There is also a minimum set of HTTP status codes which MUST be supported by
an implementation of the OCCI HTTP Protocol.

\subsection{Requests Headers}

\begin{description}
\item[Accept] An OCCI client SHOULD specify the media types of the OCCI data
formats it supports in the {\tt Accept} header.
\item[Content-type] If an OCCI client submits payload in a HTTP request
the OCCI client MUST specify the media type of the OCCI data format
in the {\tt Content-type} header.
\item[User-Agent] An OCCI client SHOULD specify the OCCI version
number in the {\tt User-Agent} header. See Section~\ref{subsec:versioning}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Response Headers}

\begin{description}
\item[Accept] An OCCI server SHOULD specify the media types of the OCCI data
formats it supports in the {\tt Accept} header.
\item[Content-type] An OCCI server MUST specify the media type of the OCCI data
format used in an HTTP response.
\item[Server] An OCCI server MUST specify the OCCI version number in the {\tt Server}
header. See Section~\ref{subsec:versioning}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Versioning}
\label{subsec:versioning}
Information about the OCCI version supported by a server implementation
MUST be advertised to a client on each response.
The version field in the response MUST include the value
OCCI/X.Y, where X is the major version number and Y is the minor
version number of the implemented OCCI version. The server
response MUST relay versioning information using the HTTP `Server'
header.

\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: occi-server/1.1 (linux) OCCI/1.2
[...]
\end{verbatim}

Complementing the server-side behavior of an OCCI implementation, a
client SHOULD indicate the version it expects to interact with. In a
client, this information SHOULD be advertised in all requests it issues.
A client request SHOULD relay versioning information in the `User-Agent'
header. The `User-Agent' header MUST include the same value (OCCI/X.Y)
as advertised by the server.

\begin{verbatim}
GET /-/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: occi-client/1.1 (linux) libcurl/7.19.4 OCCI/1.2
[...]
\end{verbatim}

If an OCCI implementation receives a request from a client that
supplies a version number higher than the server supports, the
server MUST respond back to the client with an HTTP status code indicating
that the requested version is not implemented. The \emph{HTTP 501 Not
Implemented} status code MUST be used.

OCCI implementations compliant with this version of the document MUST
use the version string \emph{OCCI/1.2}. Versioning of extensions is
out of scope for this document.

\subsection{Status Codes}
The below list specifies the minimum set of HTTP status codes an OCCI client MUST
understand. An OCCI server MAY return other HTTP status codes but the exact client
behavior in such cases is not specified. The return codes are specified by
\cite{rfc7231} and \cite{rfc7235}.

\begin{description}
\item[200 OK] indicates that the request has succeeded.
\item[201 CREATED] indicates that the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
\item[400 Bad Request] indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error
\item[401 Unauthorized] indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
\item[403 Forbidden] indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
\item[404 Not Found] indicates that the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists
\item[405 Method Not Allowed] indicates that the method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource.
\item[406 Not Acceptable] indicates that the target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent
\item[409 Conflict] indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource
\item[413 Request Entity Too Large] indicates that the request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
\item[500 Internal Server Error] indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
\item[501 Not Implemented] indicates that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
\item[503 Service Unavailable] indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance of the server
\end{description}

\section{Pagination}

To request partial results of an otherwise large collection message response, pagination SHOULD be used to reduce the load on
both the client and the service provider. This is done in the following manner.

The HTTP GET verb is used when accessing a URI of a collection and the query parameters of {\em page} and {\em number} MUST be used. {\em page} is an indexed
integer that refers to a sub-collection of the requested collection. {\em number} is an integer of items that SHOULD be displayed in one paged response.

% e.g. GET http://host/path/to/collection?page=1;number=100

If {\em number} is too large for the provider to handle (policy, technical limitations) then an \emph{HTTP 413 Request Entity Too Large} response status code MUST be issued to the requesting client.

If there is no more content to be served, the response status code issued to the requesting client MUST be an \emph{HTTP 200 OK} and the response body MUST contain an empty collection.

\section{HTTP Methods Applied to Query Interface}

\todo{\textbf{Sanity check this section against v1.1 \dots}}

\todo{\textbf{Unify the use of URI and URL throughout the text}}

\todo{\textbf{Explain formatting of subsections in this section}}

\todo{\textbf{Include an example for each (sub)section}}

This section describes the HTTP methods used to retrieve and manipulate category instances.  With the help of the query interface it is possible for the client to determine the capabilities of the OCCI implementation he refers to.

The query interface MUST be implemented by all OCCI implementations. It MUST be found at:

\begin{verbatim}
/-/
\end{verbatim}

Implementations MAY also adopt RFC 5785 \cite{rfc5785} compliance to advertise this location. Should implementations wish to advertise the Query Interface using the .well-known mechanism then they MUST use the following path served from the authority:

\begin{verbatim}
	/.well-known/org/ogf/occi/-/
\end{verbatim}

The renderings for the {\em category} instance and category {\em collection} are defined in \cite{occi:text} and \cite{occi:json}.

\subsection{GET Method}

\paragraph{Client GET request}
MAY include a possible filter rendering.

\paragraph{Server GET response}
The response MUST include a category collection rendering.

Upon a successfully request a \emph{200 OK} status code MUST be used.

\subsection{PUT Method}

N/A

\subsection{POST Method}

\paragraph{Client POST request}
MUST include at least one full category instance rendering. It MAY include a category collection rendering.

\paragraph{Server POST response}

\todo{\textbf{Unify the use of URI and URL throughout the text}}

\todo{\textbf{Explain formatting of subsections in this section}}

\todo{\textbf{Include an example for each (sub)section}}

This section describes the HTTP methods used to retrieve and manipulate
individual entity instances. An {\em entity instance} refers to an instance
of the OCCI \hl{Resource} type, OCCI \hl{Link} type or a sub-type thereof
\cite{occi:core}.

Each HTTP method described is assumed to operate
on an URL referring to a single element in a collection, an URL such as the
following:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://example.com/compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042
\end{verbatim}

The renderings for the {\em entity} and {\em action} instances are defined in \cite{occi:text} and \cite{occi:json}.

\subsection{GET Method}
The HTTP GET method retrieves a rendering of a single (existing) entity instance.

\paragraph{Client GET request}
N/A

\paragraph{Server GET response}
The message of the HTTP GET response MUST contain an entity instance rendering.

Upon a successfully request a \emph{200 OK} status code MUST be used.

\subsection{PUT Method}
The HTTP PUT method either {\em creates} a new or {\em replaces} an existing entity instance at the specified URL.

\subsubsection{Create}

\paragraph{Client PUT request}
The message MUST contain an entity instance rendering.

\paragraph{Server PUT response}
The OCCI implementation MAY either return 201 or 200 HTTP return codes. If the OCCI implementation
returns the \emph{200 OK} HTTP response code an entity instance rendering MUST be returned.
In case of a \emph{201 CREATED} HTTP response code the HTTP Location header as defined in RFC7231 \cite{rfc7231} MUST be used.

\subsubsection{Replace}
Any OCCI \hl{Link}s associated with an existing OCCI \hl{Resource} MUST be left intact.

\paragraph{Client PUT request}
The message MUST contain an entity instance rendering.

\paragraph{Server PUT response}
The OCCI implementation MAY either return 201 or 200 HTTP return codes.  If the OCCI implementation
returns the \emph{200 OK} HTTP response code an entity instance rendering MUST be returned.
In case of a \emph{201 CREATED} HTTP response code the HTTP Location header as defined in RFC7231 \cite{rfc7231} MUST be used.

\subsection{POST Method}
The HTTP POST method either {\em partially update} or triggers and {\em actions} on an existing entity instance.

\subsubsection{Partial Update}

\paragraph{Client POST request}
The message MUST contain a partial entity instance rendering of the entity instance to be changed.

\paragraph{Server POST response}
The OCCI implementation MAY either return 201 or 200 HTTP return codes. If the OCCI implementation
returns the \emph{200 OK} HTTP response an entity instance rendering MUST be returned.
In case of a \emph{201 CREATED} HTTP response code the HTTP Location header as defined in RFC7231 \cite{rfc7231} MUST be used.

\subsubsection{Trigger Action}
Actions are triggered using the HTTP POST verb and by adding a query to the URI. This query MUST contain a key-value pair. The key MUST be `action'. The value MUST equal to the \hl{Action}'s term.

\paragraph{Client POST request}
The message MUST contain an action invocation rendering.

\paragraph{Server POST response}
The message of the HTTP GET response MUST contain an entity instance rendering.

Upon a successfully request a \emph{200 OK} status code MUST be used.

\subsection{DELETE Method}
The HTTP DELETE method deletes an entity instance

\paragraph{Client DELETE request}
N/A

\paragraph{Server DELETE response}
Upon a successfully request a \emph{200 OK} status code MUST be used.

\subsubsection{Associate Mixin with Entity Instance}
This operation MUST only be available for collections defined by a \hl{Mixin}

\paragraph{Client POST request}
The request MUST include an entity collection rendering which require the \hl{Mixin} to be applied.

\paragraph{Server POST response}
On successful operation the server replies with the \emph{200 OK} HTTP status code it MUST include an entity collection rendering.

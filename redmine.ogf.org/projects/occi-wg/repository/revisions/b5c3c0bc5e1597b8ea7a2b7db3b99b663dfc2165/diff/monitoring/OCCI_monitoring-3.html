    <pre>The OCCI Core Model \cite{occi:core} is well suited for the task, since it embeds the tools needed to extend a framework with provider specific details: this enables the specification of the abstract model, leaving to the user the task of making explicit the details, targeting a specific provider or technology. Furthermore, we claim that the specifications given in this document can find an application in environments other than computing infrastructures, since we abstract from the details that characterize cloud infrastructure resources.

    <pre>Using these basic building blocks the designer is able to assemble complex, multilayer monitoring infrastructures: for instance, a \sens\ can be used to aggregate a storage throughput using the input from three \coll s, one for the average response time, one for the mean time between failures, and another for network delay, and provide the results to an upstream \sens\ that aggregates the same results from other \sens s.

A resource can be ``prepared'' for monitoring, but the way in which the Monitoring Link will interact with such preparation is not clear. In addition, consider that the same tool might be the target of several links, with distinct configuration parameter. How can the control parameters of the mixin be exposed in such a case? Instead, if the mixin is embedded in the link, it is the responsibility of the link implementation to configure it, and to couple it with the publishing technology indicated in the link}

    <pre>Note that the schema is transparent, in particular, to the existence of a standard for metric identifiers: if one exists, the interoperability of distinct monitoring infrastructures is certainly improved. We consider that the user that interacts with the monitoring infrastructures either knows about the identifiers used by the provider, or uses an interface (e.g., a SLA negotiation service) that translates provider specific identifiers into interoperable ones. This document highlights further standardization issues.

Good document!
Several comments after reading the document:
- The example regarding the merger of GGF and EGA is not very clear. It mentions the "ggf" prefix, but is unclear what that would be a prefix of. I don't think there is a urn:ggf and urn:ogf:ggf has not been mentioned before, so it is not clear.
- Page 4: "other thAn grid resources."
- I would suggest to say that a URL *may* not be suitable for resources. Multiple ways of getting to a resource is not always the case.
- Page 6 has a layout problem with the RFC reference.
- Page 6: as well *as*
- Page 6: form application of aN SNID is mad available via publication of A Grid Forum...
- Page 7: is "grid working document" not capitalised?
- Page 8: why does this state that "example-wg" is not a suitable name, when page 4 uses examples such as urn:ogf:example-wg:cloud ?

Small updates
The document as a whole is very solid, thanks primarily to Freek! A few minor updates:

page 7
<quote>
The technical director of the OGF must be notified of any (proposed) use of a namespace identifier, by contacting urn@ogf.org. The technical director of the OGF may, at his discre- tion “reserve” a subnamespace identifier for a limited period of time prior to approval of an Informational GFD document describing the namespace.

Since there is not an official position of "technical director" within OGF, I suggest we change this to :
<proposed>
The individuals responsible for maintaining OGF URNs must be notified of any (proposed) use of a namespace identifier by contacting urn@ogf.org. These individuals, at their discretion, may "reserve" a subnamespace identifier for a limited period of time prior to approval of an informational GFD document describing the namespace.
</proposed>

page 8
<quote>
Registration date: date of submission of the GFD.
</quote>

probably should be the publication date since that is more deterministic.

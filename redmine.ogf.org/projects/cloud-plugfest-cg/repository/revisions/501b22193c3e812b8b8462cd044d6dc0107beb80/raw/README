The Cloud Standards Interoperability Plugfest Series (or "Cloud Plugfests" 
for short) was originated by the OGF and SNIA in 2011 as a method to exchange 
information and to encourage interoperability on implementations of cloud 
standards. It has since expanded to include a variety of tools provided by 
these organizations and by ETSI to support the community, and is open to 
participation by other organizations.

This tool set hosted on the ogf.org site supports those community activities 
and features that are in public view according to the terms of the Open Grid 
Forum IPR. The community is welcome to make use of the tools and features 
offered here to support Cloud Plugfest activities, but should be aware that 
all documents stored here are in public view.

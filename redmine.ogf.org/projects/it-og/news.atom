&lt;h3 &gt;Dear OGF Groups,&lt;a href="#Dear-OGF-Groups" class="wiki-anchor"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Most groups have by now migrated their operations from GridForge to&lt;br /&gt;Redmine.  Over the last days, we have been migrating documents from&lt;br /&gt;the various GridForge projects to the respective Redmine projects.  We&lt;br /&gt;plan a similar migration of tracker items (sorry, we can't give a&lt;br /&gt;timeline for that, yet).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;A couple of notes about the document migration:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The documents (incl. the folder structure) have been moved into a&lt;br /&gt;    separate folder on your redmine project's document module.  That&lt;br /&gt;    folder is named 'gridforge'.  That way, the migrations would not&lt;br /&gt;    collide with existing redmine documents.  Note that you can move&lt;br /&gt;    folders and documents to other folders, as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For some GridForge projects, we do not have equivalent redmine&lt;br /&gt;    projects.  The respective documents have been moved to a separate&lt;br /&gt;    archival project:	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="http://redmine.ogf.org/dmsf/migration-archive"&gt;http://redmine.ogf.org/dmsf/migration-archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you want to have access to that project,&lt;br /&gt;    (it is publicly readable though), and if you want to have&lt;br /&gt;    parts of that archive migrated to specific redmine projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are aware of some problems, but decided not to delay the&lt;br /&gt;    migration as several groups are waiting for the documents.&lt;br /&gt;    Please let us know if you encounter faulty migrations.  In&lt;br /&gt;    particular, you may encounter folders which cannot be opened.&lt;br /&gt;    Please pop me a note, and I'll make sure that this is getting&lt;br /&gt;    fixed timely.

	&lt;p&gt;Those problems should be rare though (so far 2 documents made&lt;br /&gt;    trouble, out of O(100) checked).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;It is very likely that for many redmine accounts, permissions are not&lt;br /&gt;yet set correctly.  In particular, chair and secretary roles may not&lt;br /&gt;yet be assigned to your account. Please let me know when you have&lt;br /&gt;trouble with permissions, and I'll flip the preciousss bitsesss...&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Best, Andre.&lt;/p&gt;    </content>

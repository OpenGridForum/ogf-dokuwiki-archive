This is the UR-2.0 test suite.

It contains:

  o  a XSD for validating XML data (ur-2.0.xsd)
  o  a validation suite for validating XML data  (Makefile, which uses ur-2.0.xsd and xmllint)
  o  several example documents that illustrate the format (ur2-*.xml.gz)

For description of the UR-2.0 format, see http://redmine.ogf.org/dmsf/ur-wg

To use the validation suite, do

  make test      --- check all .xml and .xml.gz files in current directory
  make testclean --- clean up after running the tests
  make clean     --- more aggressive cleaning: removes backup files from editor

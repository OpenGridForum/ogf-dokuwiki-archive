    <pre>The submission and management of computational jobs in a distributed batch processing system is a traditional part of utility computing environments. End users and developers of domain-specific software abstractions often have to deal with the heterogeneity of such systems.

    <pre> The largest user base for massively scaled cluster environments exists in the \gls{hpc} community, where the scalable execution of massively parallel jobs is the primary goal. For several decades, the \gls{hpc} community had a primary focus on locally distributed cluster systems. Meanwhile, the federated usage of geographically distributed resources through a single interface became another important part of \gls{drms} operation -- this is the main usage mode for \emph{grid computing} environments, which is largely motivated by applications with large scientific computational and storage demands, such as the \emph{Large Hadron Collider} project.

    <pre>For each of these usage scenarios for a batch processing system, a common question is the design of interfaces to the \gls{drm} system functionality: how can they be developed so as to use as broad a range of infrastructure as possible, without vendor or middleware lock-in, yet with the flexibility and performance that is required. This question assumes greater significance in the distributed computing context, such as grids and clouds, where resource owners and users are more decoupled than for most other modes of computing.

There are three relevant method sets for working with jobs: The \emph{JobSession} interface represents all control and monitoring functions available for jobs. The \emph{Job} interface represents the common control functionality for one existing job. Sets of jobs resulting from a bulk submission are controllable as a whole by the \emph{JobArray} interface. A \emph{ReservationSession} instance acts as container for advance reservations in the DRM system, were each of them is represented by a \emph{Reservation} instance. The \emph{MonitoringSession} interface provides a set of stateless methods for fetching information about the DRM system and the DRMAA implementation itself.

    <pre>DRMAA solves this by making an explicit distinuishing between \emph{optional} and \emph{implementation-specific} features. Optional features have a clear semantic described by the DRMAA standard. They are part of the interface structures. Any application can programmatically check for the support of a particular optional feature before using it. The concept is similar to the idea of support levels in the POSIX specification series.

    <pre>With the \emph{<span>intra-VM} approach, both the \gls{drm} system and the standardized interface implementation are deployed as part of virtual machines running on cloud resources. This approach makes use of the inherent nature of IaaS offerings, where virtualized resources are used as simple remotely hosted replacement for local execution resources. In theory, it supports the re-use of existing software stacks and standards by just deploying existing middleware stacks in the cloud. This kind of approach is not new - one example from the grid computing field is the Condor GlideIn functionality for extending a Condor pool with resources from a remote Globus installation~\cite{condorgrid}. Practical experience in the grid community showed that this approach, even though it seems to hab</span>e a low entrance barrier, suffers from the dynamic nature of remote resources. Virtual machines hosted by an IaaS provider follow the dynamics defined by the operating provider, while most batch processing systems assume dedicated resource ownership for the system where they are installed. This leads to issue with the bootstrapping of cluster installations on cloud resources, the identification of machines, the handling of data traffic between multiple virtual machines. Furthermore, there is now a competition between the virtual machine resource management by the cloud provider and the resource management implemented by the deployed \gls{drm} system.

This approach makes use of the inherent nature of IaaS offerings, where virtualized resources are used as simple remotely hosted replacement for local execution resources. In theory, it supports the re-use of existing software stacks and standards by just deploying existing middleware stacks in the cloud. This kind of approach is not new - one example from the grid computing field is the Condor GlideIn functionality for extending a Condor pool with resources from a remote Globus installation~\cite{condorgrid}. Practical experience in the grid community showed that this approach, even though it seems to hav</span>e a low entrance barrier, suffers from the dynamic nature of remote resources. Virtual machines hosted by an IaaS provider follow the dynamics defined by the operating provider, while most batch processing systems assume dedicated resource ownership for the system where they are installed. This leads to issue with the bootstrapping of cluster installations on cloud resources, the identification of machines, the handling of data traffic between multiple virtual machines. Furthermore, there is now a competition between the virtual machine resource management by the cloud provider and the resource management implemented by the deployed \gls{drm} system.

    <pre>With the given set of specifications, we presented a new approach for re-using existing standards for job submission and control in infrastructure clouds. Our OCCI-DRMAA example represents an approach that combines an existing cloud interoperability specification with a specification originally targeting local \gls{drm} systems. With a finalized version of such a specification, both cloud providers and cloud customers are enabled to perform a seamless transition from cluster or grid resources to batch processing offers in the cloud.

    <pre> With the advent of cheap distributed hardware in the 80's, batch processing moved to distributed installations of collaborating computer systems, called \emph{clusters}. This lead to the development of cluster management systems for job scheduling, execution host management and monitoring. Typical examples for such systems are GridEngine, the Portable Batch System (PBS), Torque, LoadLeveler, or HTCondor. A cluster infrastructure maps incoming computational jobs to the available set of distributed resources. The largest user base for massively scaled cluster environments exists in the \gls{hpc} community, where the scalable execution of massively parallel jobs is the primary goal. For several decades, the \gls{hpc} community had a primary focus on locally distributed cluster systems, where parallel application instances are managed by a local \gls{drms} scheduler, for a set of nodes. Meanwhile, the federated usage of geographically distributed resources through a single interface became another important part of \gls{drms} operation -- this is the main usage mode for \emph{grid computing} environments, which is largely motivated by applications with large scientific computational and storage demands, such as the \emph{Large Hadron Collider} project.

    <pre>While the given hypothesis sounds straight-forward in general terms, it has many implications on the standardization of job description formats and programming interfaces details. Our experience with more than 8 years of standardization work shows that even though most people agree to this hypothesis in general, they tend to forget about it when it comes to specific design decisions. Given this hypothesis, any standardization of job submission and control in IaaS cloud environments must make a specific choice in respect to this dilemma.

    <pre>With the given set of specifications, we presented a new approach for re-using existing standards for job submission and control in infrastructure clouds. Our OCCI-DRMAA approach combines an existing cloud interoperability specification with the concept given by a cluster-focused specification targeting \gls{drm} systems. With a finalized version of this approach, both cloud providers and cloud customers are enabled to perform a seamless transition from cluster or grid resources to batch processing offers in the cloud.

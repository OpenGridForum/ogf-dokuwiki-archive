    <pre>The submission and management of computational jobs in a distributed batch processing system is a traditional part of utility computing environments. End users and developers of domain-specific software abstractions often have to deal with the heterogeneity of such systems. This lead to a number of application programming interface and job description standards in the past, which are implemented and established for cluster and grid systems.

    <pre>With the recent rise of cloud computing as new utility computing paradigm, the standardized access to batch processing facilities operated on cloud resources becomes an important issue. Furthermore, the design of such a standard has to consider a tradeoff between feature completeness and the achievable level of interoperability. This article discusses this general challenge, and presents some existing standards with traditional cluster and grid computing background that may be applicable to cloud environments. We furthermore present the OCCI-DRMAA approach as one way of defining a standardized access to batch processing facilities hosted in a cloud.

    <pre>One design perspective is the end user perspective, were humans (or their shell scripts) interact with the \gls{drm} system. Typical solutions motivated by that perspective are command-line tools and graphical user interfaces provided by the particular \gls{drm} framework. An alternative design perspective focuses more on programmatic access to the \gls{drm} system's functionality -- whenever the batch job submission is used by higher level software (e.g. meta-scheduling systems or domain-specific user interface implementations), that software controls the \gls{drm} system through some \gls{api}.

    <pre>While the given hypothesis sounds straight-forward in general terms, it has many implications on the standardization of job description formats and programming interfaces details. Our experience with more than 8 years of standardization work shows that even though most people agree to this hypothesis in general, they tend to forget about it when it comes to specific design decisions. Given this hypothesis, any standardization of job submission and control in IaaS cloud environments must make a specific choice in respect to this dilemma.

    <pre>As long as cluster systems were mainly used as organization-specific local resource, it was acceptable to realize job requirement descriptions and programmatic product access through vendor-specific solutions. With the increasing relevance of grid computing and it's federation aspect, it became more and more important to have more unified interfaces to resource management systems, as users were exposed to a multitude of system flavors within a single grid infrastructure. This lead to a number of standardization efforts, mainly in the \gls{ogf} standardization body. Different job description formats and interface approaches gained wide-spread acceptance, especially in the academic \gls{hpc} community. It is now widely and independently acknowledged that a uniform, simple and stable access layer is necessary (but not sufficient) to improve end user experience on distributed computing infrastructures.

The \emph{Job} interface represents the common control functionality for one existing job. Sets of jobs resulting from a bulk submission are controllable as a whole by the \emph{JobArray} interface. A \emph{ReservationSession} instance acts as container for advance reservations in the DRM system, were each of them is represented by a \emph{Reservation} instance.

All three standards have shown to be usable in conjunction to implement a standards-based cloud service offering \cite{citemaster_9645}. The \gls{ovf} specification defines how a deployment package for IaaS environments can be formulated in a portable way, so that virtual machine configurations are usable with different cloud offerings. \gls{cdmi} offers the means to programmatically manage cloud storage resources. \gls{occi} provides the standardized remote \gls{api} to manage the IaaS resources instances remotely hosted by the cloud provider.

    <pre>In the context of batch processing interfaces for cloud environments, the first group of specifications is the most relevant, as it applies to infrastructures which are potentially used as \gls{drms} execution resources. Prominent standards from this class are the \gls{occi} specification from the \gls{ogf}, the \gls{ovf} from the \gls{dmtf}~\cite{citemaster_9644}, and the \gls{cdmi} specification from the \gls{snia} standardization body. All three standards have been shown to be combinable to implement a standards-based cloud service offering~\cite{citemaster_9645}. The \gls{ovf} specification defines how a deployment package for IaaS environments can be formulated in a portable way, so that virtual machine configurations are usable with different cloud offerings. \gls{cdmi} offers the means to programmatically manage cloud storage resources. \gls{occi} provides the standardized remote \gls{api} to manage the IaaS resources instances hosted by different cloud providers. It therefore provides the interface to trigger operations on and within the instantiated cloud resources.

This leads to issue with the bootstrapping of cluster installations on cloud resources, the identification of machines, the handling of data traffic between multiple virtual machines.

    <pre>An alternative approach is the \emph{inter-VM} concept, where the standardized batch processing functionality becomes part of the cloud offering. The job submission and control interface is implemented by the cloud provider, either by the help of the (anyway existing) cloud resource management framework or by the integration of some \gls{drm} system in the cloud infrastructure.

    <pre>As all \gls{api}s initially intended for local library implementations, DRMAA supports the notion of blocking status wait calls for both the \emph{Job} and the \emph{JobSession} interface.

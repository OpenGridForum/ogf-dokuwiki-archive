    <pre>When cluster systems were mainly used as organization-specific local resource, it was acceptable to realize job requirement descriptions and programmatic product access through vendor-specific solutions. With the increasing relevance of federations and grid computing, it became increasingly important to provide inform interfaces to resource management systems, as users were exposed to a multitude of system flavors within a single grid infrastructure. This lead to a number of standardization efforts, mainly in the \gls{ogf} standardization body. Different job description formats and interface approaches gained wide-spread acceptance, especially in the academic \gls{hpc} community. It is now widely acknowledged that a uniform, simple and stable access layer is necessary (but not sufficient) to improve end user experience on distributed computing infrastructures.

One group of cloud standards targets the lifecycle management of service offerings such as virtual machines (IaaS), applications (PaaS) or software blocks (SaaS). Those standards typically cover the deployment and initialization of new instances, instance management operations, backup operations, bootstrapping support and security.

    <pre>With the \emph{VM-internal} approach, both the \gls{drm} system and the standardized interface implementation are deployed as part of virtual machines running on cloud resources. This approach makes use of the inherent nature of IaaS offerings, where virtualized resources are used as simple remotely hosted replacement for local execution resources. In theory, it supports the re-use of existing software stacks and standards by just deploying existing middleware stacks in the cloud. This kind of approach is not new - one example from the grid computing field is the Condor GlideIn functionality for extending a Condor pool with resources from a remote Globus installation~\cite{condorgrid}. Practical experience in the grid community showed that this approach, even though it seems to have a low entrance barrier, suffers from the dynamic nature of remote resources. Virtual machines hosted by an IaaS provider follow the dynamics defined by the operating provider, while most batch processing systems assume dedicated resource ownership for the system where they are installed. This leads to issue with the bootstrapping of cluster installations on cloud resources, the identification of machines, the handling of data traffic between multiple virtual machines. Furthermore, there is now a competition between the virtual machine resource management by the cloud provider and the resource management implemented by the deployed \gls{drm} system.

    <pre>One design perspective is the end user perspective, were humans (or their shell scripts) interact with the \gls{drm} system. Typical solutions motivated by that perspective are command-line tools and graphical user interfaces provided by the particular \gls{drm} framework. An alternative design perspective focuses more on programmatic access to the \gls{drm} system's functionality -- whenever the batch job submission is used by higher level software (e.g. meta-scheduling systems or domain-specific user interface implementations), that software controls the \gls{drm} system through some \gls{api}.

    <pre>Whether the \gls{drm} system is controlled through user tools or through a product \gls{api}, it must be possible to describe job requirements in some format. This relates to the fact that batch processing is inherently tied to non-interactive jobs, where the request for execution is formulated as a set of job parameters. This includes properties such as the executable name and location, and hardware and operating system requirements. Such \emph{job description} is handed over to the \gls{drm} system for interpretation, scheduling and finally execution.

    <pre>\emph{Interoperability}, on the other hand, describes the possibility for horizontal interaction of software entities in a distributed system. If the standardized interface or job description format implementation of the \gls{drm} system is exposed to remote clients, such as with web service technology, it is described as \emph{interoperable} interface. In a cloud computing environment, system interoperability relates to the kind of service interfaces offered by the cloud provider.

    <pre>The implemented level of portability provided by a standard can be further sub-divided into approaches that utilize \emph{introspection} for portability, or the ones that do not rely on such a mechanism. Introspection is a well-known concept in programming language theory and describes the ability of a running program to examine types and values of object properties at run-time. In the context of standardized \gls{drm} system interfaces, we refer to the following definition:

    <pre>The \gls{jsdl} specification from \gls{ogf} defines a data scheme for job attributes, their inter-relationship and their value range. Job descriptions based on this schema can be re-used in different \gls{drm} systems that support the specification. \gls{jsdl} therefore provides portability for the job description itself, but does explicitely not consider the interfaces for job management and monitoring. Since re-use of job descriptions is one of the primary design goals in \gls{jsdl}, several description properties are limited. One example is the explicitely not supported notion of maximum job run-time, since this is an environment-specific property that cannot be reused.

This fulfils the goal of best-possible feature coverage in a standardized document format, while still maintaining some level of job description portability.

    <pre>The BES specification distinguishes between different Web Service port types (see also \cite{citemaster_579}) for factory operations, activities and management operations. The standard provides a basic state model for activities, which explicitely is intended for being extended by implementations. The idea here is to support ``composable specializations'' based on a common meta model that can support a variety of activities. Examples for from the BES specification are data staging and job suspend operations.

    <pre>With the focus on standardized batch processing interfaces in the cloud, the first group of specifications is most interesting here. Prominent standards from this class the area of IaaS are the \gls{occi} specification from \gls{ogf}, the \gls{ovf} by the \gls{dmtf} \cite{ovf}, and the \gls{cdmi} specification from the \gls{snia} standardization body. All three standards have shown to be usable in conjunction to implement a standards-based cloud service offering \cite{infoq_occi}. The \gls{ovf} specification defines how a deployment package for IaaS environments can be formulated in a portable way, so that virtual machine configurations are usable with different cloud offerings. \gls{cdmi} offers the means to programmatically manage cloud storage resources. \gls{occi} provides the standardized remote \gls{api} to manage the IaaS resources instances remotely hosted by the cloud provider. It therefore provides the interface to trigger operations on and within the instantiated cloud resources.

    <pre>With the \emph{intra-VM} approach, both the \gls{drm} system and the standardized interface implementation are deployed as part of virtual machines running on cloud resources. This approach makes use of the inherent nature of IaaS offerings, where virtualized resources are used as simple remotely hosted replacement for local execution resources. In theory, it supports the re-use of existing software stacks and standards by just deploying existing middleware stacks in the cloud. This kind of approach is not new - one example from the <span>Grid computing field is the Condor GlideIn functionality for extending a Condor pool with resources from a remote Globus installation \cite{condorgrid}. Practical experience in the G</span>rid community showed that this approach, even though it seems to habe a low entrance barrier, suffers from the dynamic nature of remote resources. Virtual machines hosted by an IaaS provider follow the dynamics defined by the operating provider, while most batch processing systems assume dedicated resource ownership for the system where they are installed. This leads to issue with the bootstrapping of cluster installations on cloud resources, the identification of machines, the handling of data traffic between multiple virtual machines. Furthermore, there is now a competition between the virtual machine resource management by the cloud provider and the resource management implemented by the deployed \gls{drm} system.

    <pre>An alternative approach is the \emph{inter-VM} concept, where the standardized batch processing functionality becomes part of the cloud offering. The job submission and control interface is implemented by the cloud provider, either by the help of the (anyway existing) cloud resource management framework or by the integration of some \gls{drm} system in the cloud infrastructure. Such an offering can be interpreted as SaaS offering, since the provider enables the remote utilization of a new kind of software functionality.

These stakeholders are now about to introduce Cloud offerings for their resources, in order to maximize utilization and gain some revenue from the provisioning. A second relevant trend is the rise of \emph{Private Cloud} solutions, were organizations operate their own cloud infrastructure for the purpose of easier management and internal accounting. Both trends lead to the fact that classical job submission is also about to become a relevant topic in cloud computing infrastructures.

The working group of Stephen Pickles, Yoshio Tanaka, Sinichi Mineo, Von Welch 
and myself have discussed briefly a "plan for a plan" toward establishing a 
first level of interoperability between our grids. We have developed the 
following draft outline of steps with a natural milestone date for Step 3 but no 
obvious milestone dates for the subsequent steps. Those will be influenced by 
further discussion and results of other groups (particularly the agreement on 
driving use case(s) ).

Step 1:  Identify the near term requirements and goals for minimal useful 
	interoperability.  (draft is done and appended below)
Step 2:  Identify the consensus implementations to be globally supported to 
	achieve this for this first phase. (draft below contains our current 
	proposal. We have not yet completed a review for completeness.)
Step 3:  Present this information in the GGF Authorization workshop in Athens 
	and solicit feedback from the other interested grids and users. 	(GGF16)
Step 4: Deploy consensus implementations or develop adapters to translate to 
	local implementations.
Step 5: Conduct an interoperability fest to establish functionality and debug 
	with experts.
Step 6: Communicate the completion of this effort to our target user base(s).




Step 1 - Requirements:

First step is to identify the requirements to establish the basic level of 
interoperability between our various grids needed to serve our user community in 
accomplishing their first steps.  We believe the following will be sufficient to 
allow information request, basic job submission and file transfer. We not all 
services within a grid will need to accept requests from sources external to the 
grid, so we are identifying requirements only for services which are to 
participate in cross-grid requests. We name these "InterGrid services" below.

Identity:

An X.509 identity certificate is necessary to identify services and requesters 
for grid transactions. In order to have a manageable set of known identity 
sources, we agree to use the set of CAs identified as accredited by PMAs which 
are members of the International Grid Trust Federation as the common set of 
known identity sources.

Grids (or Sites) may individually reject any or all of the CA and/or add 
additional ones, but the expectation is that the grid infrastructure will 
propagate and maintain these known CA credentials, signing-policy files and CRLs 
throughout their infrastructure such that authorization of an authentic request 
from an entity identified by one of these CAs COULD be authorized if so desired.

Authentication:

All InterGrid services which require authentication will be able to perform at 
least one of: GSI authentication or OGSA Basic Profile authentication. The Basic 
Profile authentication is described in GGF document XXX (and is tied to TLS).

Authorization (expression and transport):

We will use "push mode" authorization with authorization attributes encoded as 
VOMS proxy extensions as the basic authorization transport mechanism. VOMS 
extensions have two attributes: "groups" and "roles". The meaning of the strings 
assigned to these roles is valid only within the context of a single attribute 
authority (eg. a VOMS server or whatever else generates the attributes). 
Propagating the meaning of these strings will be done out of band between the 
parties.

Authorization (policy expression and interpretation):

We will not attempt to implement a common policy expression/interpretation 
standard at this level. We'll have to watch and see what comes from the 
SAML/Shibboleth/WS-* discussions. At the moment this will have to be manual and 
out of band.

Delegation:

The common method for all InterGrid services which need delegated credentials 
will be either GSI delegation of RFC 3280 proxy credentials or the result of the 
WS-Delegation discussions underway now. We expect that most InterGrid requests 
will NOT require delegation.

Re-Delegation:

We do not assume that InterGrid services will provide automatic renewal of 
credentials. We make the assumption (at least at this level of interoperation) 
that requesters will renew a delegation if needed. This implies that all 
InterGrid services which support delegation should also support re-delegation to 
renew credentials before they expire without interrupting the request.

Audit/Accounting:

We do not yet know what agreements are required for audit and/or accounting 
between grids.

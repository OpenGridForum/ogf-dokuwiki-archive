* Q&A on Financial Services Use Case

- How to integrate (gridify) financial applications with grid
  middleware (schedulers)
  + Most ISVs have integrated versions of their software with some
    grid middleware (scheduler). They are grid enabled but this is not
    necessarily visible to the user
- Is the interface (between application and middleware) used
  proprietary ?
  + Typically yes, unless the ISV has put in an abstraction layer of
    their own
- Would a standard interface be of interest to ISVs?
  + Probably
- Maybe DRMAA is a candidate for this?
  + Could be; need to review requirements in more detail
- 1,000,000 events/sec: What percentage has to be handled rather than
  thrown away?
  + Depends on size of institution. Larger ones will handle larger
    percentage of messages; even if it is something trivial. Do not
    have clear figures but could be something like 2/3
- Is it possible to predict processing based on message content?
  + Should be possible. Some processing can be fairly simple; e.g.,
    update price. Or it can take longer if it is processing to
    'compute portfolio'
- Which percentage is of msec order rather than minutes?  
  + Automating more and more so the order should decrease
- Workflow: is it feed forward flows with single inputs or n-degree?
  + single input but might have multiple outputs that evaluate
    different conditions or scenarios
- How is a global view of data maintained? Some systems use
  transaction caches, not sure of details.

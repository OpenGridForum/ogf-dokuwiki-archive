Frankly, I never understood the purpose of the text/plain rendering, for exactly the reasons Cyril stated in his e-mail, and I very much doubt the idea of text/occi. Actually, both make implementing the spec quite a pain.

Personally, I like the idea of using the headers for transporting REST resource metadata, as long as we don't overdo it -- I think the Link headers are a good example of doing the right thing.  

Regarding categories, I am quite confident that, for indicating the "kind" of a resource (clearly being metadata), the "Category" header is a good way of doing it. For filtering, I'd support Cyril in so far that query strings have been made for exactly this purpose.

Just my two cents to keep the fire burning ;-)

        <pre wrap="">Hi Thijs,

I didn't talk about `text/plain` because IMO it's even worse than `text/occi`.
How a user-agent is supposed to know that it's receiving a payload containing
OCCI attributes? Looking at the `Content-Type` header it'll just assume that
it is receiving free-form text from the server. Unless it has out-of-band
knowledge of which &lt;HTTP verb/URI&gt; tuple is supposed to return OCCI-formatted
content. Which is not something you would expect from a "RESTful" spec. I'm
actually a bit surprised that this has been made the default content-type.

Regarding your comment about filtering, I must say I don't see how this
relates to the media type discussion. Filtering is usually achieved using
query strings, or (what you're already doing) the use of `Category` headers.
If you had a proper media type, you could also define URI templates for this.
My point being that I don't understand the relationship between not putting a
body in the `GET` request (which is indeed wrong), and the need for
`text/occi` in addition to `text/plain`. I may have misunderstood your comment
though ;-)

Cheers,

Cyril

Hi,

Thanks for your reply - much appreciated.

Just a quick note from me: The default rendering of OCCI is text/plain and than the content goes in the body. The reason for the text/occi rendering are mostly historical :-) Or because of filtering we don't want to have something in the body of an GET request...

There are also some efforts going on to create JSON renderings for OCCI...just FYI.

Cheers,

Hi Andy, all,

It's hard to be constructive in 140 characters, so thanks for letting me
elaborate on this list.

My concerns are related to the "RESTful HTTP Rendering" spec [1], which views
HTTP headers as the primary mean of transferring resource representations
between a user-agent and an OCCI server. I can see how you you may have ended
there (no need to define a media type, "universality" of the HTTP protocol,
new RFC drafts about `Category` [4] and `Link` [5] headers popping up, etc.),
but that just looks wrong to me for the following reasons:

* The most obvious, and a point that you raise in the spec [1], is that the
  HTTP header max size is often limited by intermediaries (for instance,
  default limit on Squid is 20KB [2]), while body max size is not. The spec
  warns:

  "Space in the HTTP header section of a HTTP request is a limited resource.
  By this, it is noted that many HTTP servers limit the number of bytes that
  can be placed in the HTTP Header area. Implementers MUST be aware of this
  limitation in their own implementation and take appropriate measures so that
  truncation of header data does NOT occur."

  You can't assume that there won't be intermediaries between the user-agent
  and the server (proxies, caches, etc.), therefore I don't see how an
  implementer can do anything about the header size limit, which means it is
  safe to assume that the HTTP Rendering via `text/occi` is broken (unless you
  have already thought about a possible solution, in which case it should be
  included in the spec). You can't even use the `Content-MD5` [3] header to
  provide an end-to-end message integrity check. And the message header is not
  compressible, contrary to the message body.

* More generally, methods and headers are there to indicate the purpose of a
  request, not the resource representation itself.

* Finally, you define a `text/occi` content-type, which looks like an empty
  shell. I mean, if I understand correctly, the only payload you'll ever have
  is "OK" on successful operations. AFAIK, a media type definition [6] is
  mainly about the structure and semantics of the message body. It's not about
  defining custom HTTP headers to replace the message body.

I also have some concerns about the filtering mechanism, linking mechanism and
the way you define actions, but if I had to sum up my position it would be
that I have the feeling that you went extreme with the REST concept, and tried
to put in the spec as much novelty (in terms of recent HTTP-related
specs/drafts) as you could. Nothing wrong with that, but the result is
somewhat convoluted. Also, the decision to put everything in the header part
of the message renders a lot of standard HTTP header fields useless.

I appreciate the effort and time it takes to build a spec like this. From a
standardization body though, I would have expected that you properly define a
new media type for the rendering, not custom header extensions. I recall a
(now dead?) XHTML based rendering doc, which had some flaws but was going more
in that direction. I can see that you plan on specifying new content types in
the future: I think it would be good to shift the attention back to the body.

Thank you for your time.
Best Regards,

Cyril

I saw some of your comments [1] [2] on twitter about OCCI. It'd be great if you could elaborate on them on the list as everyone here really values useful and constructive comments and critique.

BTW: you might have been viewing older OCCI specs. The latest published are here [3].

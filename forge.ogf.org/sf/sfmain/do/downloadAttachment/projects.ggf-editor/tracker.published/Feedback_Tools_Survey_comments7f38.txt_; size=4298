First of all, let me say that IMHO this is a solid document with lots
of hard data that clearly points the way for further work.  All of my
comments below are primarily about organization and presentation of
the material, with the goal of maximizing this document's
effectiveness.

Done: 1) Towards the end of the Intro, you mention getting responses to the
"test survey" and then changing things for the final online survey.
I think it would be good to briefly summarize what those changes were.
(Which areas needed clarification.)

2) Section 2.3.  Item (6) in the first list evidently is an item in
the second list!

Done: 3) Section 3.1, Design Cycle subsection.  Figures 1 and 2 are very
important figures since they capture what the real properties are
that users want from their grid applications.  These figures are,
however, duplicates of the bar charts that appear in Section 4.3.
I understand the motivation for presenting these charts up front
in the "Conclusions" section but it seems a little odd to repeat them.
Also, aside from "scalability" being the clear #1 priority for
large-scale systems, it is hard to determine how these properties
rank.  Perhaps rather than duplicating the bar charts, you could
have a table that lists the properties according to their weighted
ranking:

Scalability	1.18
Robustness	3.08
Fault Tol	3.36
Modularity	3.45
Recovery Mech	4.00

Flexibility	2.27
Hetero		2.36
Compatibility	2.50
Security	2.50
Single Login	4.10
Redesign	4.27

(You might want to double-check my numbers.)  While an exact ranking
like this might be somewhat artificial, it makes it much easier to see
what's on top, what's on the bottom, and the dynamic range among the
properties.  (Everything ranked close together is essentially
interchangable.  We could compute p-values to determine what is
statistically significant but I don't think we need to go that far.;-)
These tables would also have a forward reference to the bar charts to
tell the reader where the rankings come from.

Also, printed in B&W, the color-coding breaks down.  It would
be good to fix this.

Done: 4) Section 3.1, Software Development Cycle, 2nd paragraph.
With a list of percentages like this, it might be easier to read
if it was in a bullet list or a table.

Done: 5) Section 3.1, Debugging Cycle, 3nd paragraph.
"4) Dynamic Issues are additional ..."

Done: 6) Beginning of Section 4.  Why does the list of 7 parts start with
Number 8?  Is this an example of MS Word trying to be "too helpful"?

Done: 7) Section 4.2, Item 4.  This may be picky but I would reverse the
order of "Used" and "System" in the bar chart.  This makes the chart
follow the same order as the data in the preceeding tables and makes
it easier to read and comprehend.

Done: 8) References.  The reference numbers do not always follow the
citations in the body of the doc.  Please straighten them out.
Also, shouldn't it be "R. Hood and G. Jost" (no "s")?

Done: 9) Appendix B:  The ATLAS entry has links for BLAS and LAPACK.
It might be nice to spell-out the URLs such that someone that
just has a hardcopy of the doc can still get to the web sites.
The "Visual MPI" entry has no reference info; a URL or some
other bibliographic reference would be good.

Done: 10) General Comment: MS Word will silently split tables and figures &
captions across page breaks making the document harder to read and
look just plain unprofessional.  Let's fix these things in the final
doc.

Done: 11) This is probably my most important suggestion: the Executive
Summary is really the meat, the pay-off, for the whole document.
I think it would really be good to explicitly state a set of
"Recommendations" as part of this summary.  You basically state some
of this information (e.g., libraries such as Lapack should be
grid-enabled, debuggers need to be grid-enabled, etc.) but all of this
should be reiterated explicitly.  These recommendations should also be
stated in the Abstract since this is the major contribution of the
whole document, and is supported by all hard survey data that you
twisted arms to collect.  The word "recommendations" may be a bad
choice since it collides with the GGF name for a standards document
but you get the idea.

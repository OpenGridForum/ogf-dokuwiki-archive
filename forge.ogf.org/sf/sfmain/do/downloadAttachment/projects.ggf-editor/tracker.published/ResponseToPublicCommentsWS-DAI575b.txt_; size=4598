Web Services Data Access and Integration - The Core (WS-DAI) Specification
https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/index.php?aid=1711

Thanks to those who have provided comments on this and the descendent specs.
Here are some notes on how we propose to respond.

#1 Comments_WS-DAI_from_Oleg.doc

https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/download.php?group_id=90&atid=414&file_id=736&aid=1711

Response:

Oleg has provided a collection of comments and suggestions relating to the
clarity of the document and its consistency with terminology used elsewhere.
We propose to go through these carefully during the revision process, making
changes either as proposed, or at least to try to address the questions 
raised.  We do not envisage any changes to the substance of the specifications 
from these comments, and thus do not discuss the individual comments here.


#2 Comments WS-DAI from Dave Berry.doc

Response:

Dave has provided a collection of comments that, like those from Oleg, 
relate to the clarity of the document and its consistency with terminology 
used elsewhere.  As before, we propose to go through these carefully during 
the revision process, making changes either as proposed or at least to try 
to address the questions raised.

Several of the comments made merit a more focused response:

Comment: Has this document been reviewed by the OGSA WG on an OGSA telcon 
or at an OGSA F2F?  I know DAIS has had good links with OGSA; I think it 
would be beneficial to both groups to have a review of the final document.

Response: There hasn't been a formal group-to-group interaction.  I posted 
to the OGSA-WG to let it be known that the DAIS specifications were entering 
public comment.  As he is Chair of the OGSA Data Architecture Working Group, 
my inclination is to see the comments from Dave as representing informed 
feedback from the OGSA community.  I think there have been quite a lot of
chances for OGSA-WG people to comment (e.g. through public comment and at
GGF16), and am not sure that I think we should explore further mechanisms.
Of course, we will be happy to contribute to OGSA Data Architecture WG 
Sessions at GGF17 if this is felt to be appropriate, but there has been
quite close engagement over several years.


Comment: How should users find what other URIs are supported?  I suggest 
that GGF maintain a registry of data formats, which vendors can update as 
appropriate.  There’s no need to record every XML schema, but every 
description language, of which XSD is one, should be recorded.

Response: I agree that this could be useful. Outside the scope of the DAIS
Working Group, though.


Comment: I suggest that DAIS defines an initial set of language URIs, 
particularly for established languages.  Then GGF should maintain a 
registry of language URIs that vendors etc. may update with their own 
URIs.

Response: This seems plausible for the XML query languages, and we will
check with XML database specialists that it makes sense to do this in
WS-DAIX.  Alas, it's a known open issue for relational databases that we
don't know how to solve.

Comment: A free format description of the data resource represented by 
a data service.  I don’t understand the intention - is this to allow a 
human-readable description?

Response: Yes.

Issue: The issue is with the parent-sensitive to child and vice versa
thing.  I expect  the most common form of sensitivity is the "unknown" 
form i.e., where updates going on might or might not be visible within 
a row-set or by way of an indirect data service.  The current enums 
let you say that you will see them, or you won't see them, but not 
"you might see them".
 
Comment: I agree that the current terms state either that you do or you
don't, and don't accommodate uncertainty.  Options include to extend the
vocabulary as suggested, or to revise the existing definitions to indicate 
that it is "insensitive" if no change will ever be reflected in the 
related data resource, and that it is "sensitive" otherwise.  As such, 
no guarantee is provided that a change will be reflected in the related 
data resource, but an implementation either includes functionality to
reflect the change or not - if it includes and activates such functionality,
then it is sensitive.  This needs discussed around interested parties to
reach a consensus.  Please can people with a view post to the DAIS-WG
list.

Interoperability Testing for DAIS Working Group Specifications
https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/index.php?aid=1768

Issue:

I wish to encourage those responsible for carrying out these tests that
a watchful eye is kept on process capture and improvement, so as to
serve the broader community as a proposed best practice for future
interoperability testing. I also agree with others' comments that this
document should be more carefully reviewed by and agreed to by all
Standards ADs as an appropriate methodology for testing the DAIS specs.

Response: 

We hope that the document provides some clear principles that will be of
help to others developing interoperability testing strategies; we will
seek to ensure that the follow-up community practice document relating 
the results of the interoperability tests can be easily related back to
this document.  We will also make the actual tests available at that time.

We are happy for all standards based ADs to comment on the document, but
don't want there to be lengthy delays while this happens.  As the presence
of this document was flagged to all members of the GFSG early in the public
comment period, I suggest that everyone has now had an appropriate chance 
to comment.  We are keen to proceed to implement the strategy described 
here within the lifetime of current limited project funding.

Issue:

The only question that occured to me, was who adjudicates whether the
expected return message is correct, as many of the query languages
hosted through DAI are not so specific that simple textual comparison
will demonstrate equivalence, e.g. numbers may be in a different form,
terms or sibling document branches may be in a different order.

Response:

Where the tests are sensitive to such problems, textual comparisons must
be avoided. In some cases it will not be possible to specify the exactly
what an operation should return, as this reflects a property of the data
resource accessed by the data service. In such a case, the response message 
should be validated against its schema, and the existence of specific values 
should be tested, regardless of order and wherever possible taking into 
account different formats etc. This is practical to implement because of 
the availability of tools such as Axis which marshal XML responses into 
Java objects which can be manipulated more easily regardless of such
problems. It is proposed that changes are made to section 4.1 to state
this explicitly in the document.

Issue:

It seems implicit in this document that complete interoperability
testing of the specification is not practical. I think it would be
useful to state this explicitly in the introduction. At present the
document seems to skirt around the issue.

Response:

We propose adding the following text at the end of section 1 to address
this comment: "The DAIS specifications define behaviors that may vary 
between different valid implementations of the specifications; such
differences principally reflect variety in the data resources to 
which the services provide access.  It is therefore not practical
to test every behavior that could possibly be exhibited by a DAIS 
service without implementing or emulating large numbers of data 
resource management systems. However, the testing process detailed in 
this document aims to test all mandatory features of the specifications 
and as many optional features as is practical given the capabilities
of the resource management systems accessed by the services that are
bring tested."

#4 Dave Berry, 2006-04-05

Issue:

The document suggests that WSRF properties should not be tested. This
seems odd to me. While the base WSRF functionality will no doubt be
tested elsewhere, shouldn't the DAIS tests check that an implementation
is returning the correct properties?

Response:

The WS-DAI specifications allow properties to be accessed in two ways:
through mandatory operations defined by the WS-DAI specification, and 
optionally via WS-Resource Properties. Regardless of the method used, 
access is to the same property values.  The objective of the tests is 
principally to determine whether or not property values are correct.  
Therefore we propose only to test for the correctness of property values
via the mandatory property access operations, and not to test additional
operations defined in other specifications that may be used alongside 
the DAIS specifications.

#5 Malcolm Atkinson, 2006-04-11

Issue:

I believe that the intention is to verify that correct information is
returned, e.g. for a request for ResourceProperties. I believe that all
of the functions that can be checked for consistence should be verified
and I think that was the intention of the document.

Response:

Agreed, however, we suggest that we can test for the correctness of
property values using the messages defined in the DAIS specifications
without providing large numbers of additional tests using operations
from other specifications that may not be used with DAIS.

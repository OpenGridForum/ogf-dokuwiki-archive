\section{introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are persistent, globally unique identifiers~\cite{rfc2141,rfc3406}.

An identifiers labels a resource, which facilitates unambiguous identification of that resource by different entities. 
Any resource can be named, including a work, an instance of a work, an entry in a ontology or the ontology as a whole.

\subsection{Notational Conventions}
\label{sec:rfc2119}

\newcommand{\MUST}{\textsc{must}}
\newcommand{\MUSTNOT}{\textsc{must not}}
\newcommand{\REQUIRED}{\textsc{required}}
\newcommand{\SHALL}{\textsc{shall}}
\newcommand{\SHALLNOT}{\textsc{shall not}}
\newcommand{\SHOULD}{\textsc{should}}
\newcommand{\SHOULDNOT}{\textsc{should not}}
\newcommand{\RECOMMENDED}{\textsc{recommended}}
\newcommand{\MAY}{\textsc{may}}
\newcommand{\OPTIONAL}{\textsc{optional}}

The key words ``\MUST{}'' ``\MUSTNOT{}'', ``\REQUIRED{}'', ``\SHALL{}'', ``\SHALLNOT{}'', ``\SHOULD{}'', ``\SHOULDNOT{}'', ``\RECOMMENDED{}'', ``\MAY{}'',  and ``\OPTIONAL{}'' are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119~\cite{rfc2119}.
% except that the words do not appear in uppercase. 

\subsection{Globally Uniqueness of URNs}%
\label{sec:uniqueness}

\cite{rfc3406} stipulates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A URN \MUSTNOT{} be assigned to more than one resource. 
  \item A URN \MUSTNOT{} be re-assigned to a different resource.
  \item A single resource \MAY{} have more than one URN assigned to it for different purposes.
\end{itemize}

For the purpose of this document, we will call an identifier \emph{unique} if
adheres to the first two requirements above. So a unique identifier
identifies only one resource, although one resource does not have to be
represented by a single identifier.

Any organisation that assigns identifiers to its resources must adhere to the
above requirements. This ensures that the identifiers assigned by the
organisation are unique. However, this only ensures that the identifier is
locally unique, but does not yet guarantee that the identifier is globally
unique.

To ensure global uniqueness of identifiers, each local identifier is
prepended with a \emph{prefix} which in itself is a unique identifier of the
organisation that assigns the local identifiers. In the context of URNs, this
prefix is often referred to as a \emph{namespace identifier}. The group of
all identifiers that start with a certain prefix is called a
\emph{namespace}. 
A second purpose of a prefix is to provide a cue for the
type of resource being identified.

For example, a working group in the OGF may define an ontology with three
terms, identified by their names \emph{Grid}, \emph{Cloud}, and
\emph{Cluster}. A different organisation may use the same terms, but with
different meaning. To prevent ambiguity when using these terms, the working
group may register the namespace identifier \texttt{urn:ogf:example-wg}, and
use the identifiers \texttt{urn:ogf:example-wg:grid},
\texttt{urn:ogf:example-wg:cloud} and \texttt{urn:ogf:example-wg:cluster}.
When these identifiers are used, it is unambiguous which concept is being
referred to.

This document describes the procedure to register a namespace identifier
within the \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace.

\subsection{Persistency of URNs}%
\label{sec:persistency}

The goal of URNs is to provide persistent identification of resources. An
identifier must remain valid and unmodified from its creation to well beyond
the lifespan of the resource it identifies. This persistency is the
responsibility of the organisation maintaining the URN namespace as well as
the delegate organisation(s) that assign the identifier.

The requirement that no URN can be re-assigned only partly ensures longevity.
An identifier \MUSTNOT{} change name, and (where applicable) validation and resolution procedures \SHOULD{} still yield results, even after the following events:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the resource ceases to exist; 
  \item the properties of the resources changes; 
  \item a new version of the resource is created; 
  \item the namespace organisation ceases to exist; 
  \item the organisation that assigned the identifier ceases to exist; or 
  \item the organisation that assigned the identifier changes its name.
\end{itemize}

For example, the Open Grid Forum (OGF) emerged from the merger of the Global
Grid Forum (GGF) and Enterprise Grid Alliance (EGA) in 1996. Namespaces
created before that time still have \texttt{ggf} in their prefix, and this
\MUSTNOT{} change, as not to break the persistency of the identifier.

\section{Selecting a Namespace}%
\label{sec:namespace_selection}

Organisations that wish to assign identifiers in a namespace must select a prefix. 
This document describes how to register a prefix in the \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace.
Alternative namespaces include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace, as described in this document.
  \item \texttt{urn:} namespace, as maintained by the IETF and IANA.
  \item \texttt{http://schemas.ogf.org/} namespace (a location identifier that serves as a resource identifier).
  \item Prefix in the handle system \cite{rfc3650}.
\end{itemize}

URNs in the \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace are suited for identifying individual grid resources.

URNs in the \texttt{urn} namespace are suited for identifying resources other then grid resources.

A URL may be suitable as identifier for ontologies and schemata (even though
a URL only identifies the location of a resource, not the resource itself),
as the URL can double as the location where the normative schemata definition
can be found. URLs are not suitable to identify individual resources, as the
same may be available from multiple locations, or may not be accessible via a
HTTP mechanism in the first place, or may outlive the lifetime of the HTTP
schema (e.g. when the resource location is changed to use HTTPS).

Systems that like to integrate with the handle system for resource resolution
of digital resources may consider using the identifiers used in the handle
system.

DNS-based identifiers are generally not recommended for persistent identifiers.

\section{Syntax of URN:OGF identifiers}%
\label{sec:syntax}

The canonical syntax of URNs in the \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace is specified in section 2.4 of \cite{draft-dijkstra-urn-ogf}. This section is replicated here.

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{OGF-URN  =  "urn:ogf:" SNID ":" SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING}
\end{quote}

where \texttt{SNID} is a unique subnamespace identifier, and \texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING} is a unique local identifier within the namespace with the prefix \texttt{"urn:ogf:" SNID ":"}.

\texttt{SNID} has the same syntax as a \texttt{NID} as defined in \cite{rfc2141}:

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{SNID  =  ( ALPHA / DIGIT )  *31( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )}
\end{quote}

\texttt{ALPHA} and \texttt{DIGIT} are defined in Appendix B of \cite{rfc5234}.

Both \texttt{"urn:ogf:"} and the subnamespace identifiers are case insensitive.

The next section describes the procedure how subnamespace identifiers are assigned by the OGF.

The syntax of \texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING} is dependent on the \texttt{SNID}.
\cite{draft-dijkstra-urn-ogf} does not pose any additional restrictions to the
\texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING} other than what is defined in the
\texttt{NSS} syntax as defined by \cite{rfc2141} or its successor:

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>}
\end{quote}

\texttt{<URN chars>} is defined in Section 2.2 of \cite{rfc2141}.

At the moment of writing, a revision of \cite{rfc2141} is proposed, 
which may allow a different set of allowed characters (URN-char) in 
the NSS than the current URN chars (adding \texttt{"\&"} and/or 
\texttt{"~"}, whilst removing the reserved characters \texttt{"\%"}, 
\texttt{"/"}, \texttt{"?"} and \texttt{"\#"}) \cite{rfc2141bis}. 
The intention of this document is to only restrict the syntax of the 
\texttt{SNID}, and have Grid Forum Documents specify the syntax of the 
\texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING}. If RFC 2141 is to be updated, 
this document may be revised as well.

In other words, the current definition:

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN chars>}
\end{quote}

is likely to change in the future to:

\begin{quote}
  \texttt{SUBNAMESPACE-SPECIFIC-STRING  =  1*<URN-char>}
\end{quote}

It is \RECOMMENDED{} that assigned OGF URNs only characters acceptable by both RFC2141 and the expected revision. 
It is \RECOMMENDED{} that software implementation accepting OGF URNs allow characters acceptable by either RFC2141 or the expected revision.

\section{Procedure for Registering a Namespace Identifier}%
\label{sec:procedure}

The Open Grid Forum delegates part of their namespace \texttt{urn:ogf:} by
assigning subnamespace identifiers (\texttt{SNID}s). The formal application
for a SNID is made via publication of an Grid Forum Document (GFD). The GFD
should be an Information Document, and should be published according to the
normal procedure as describe in \cite{gfd152} or its successor.

The template defined in section~\ref{sec:template} SHOULD be included as
(part of) an GFD that registers a namespace.

The Open Grid Forum maintains a registry of namespace identifiers in the \texttt{urn:ogf:} namespace at the URL \url{http://www.ogf.org/urn/} \cite{urn-ogf}.

It is \RECOMMENDED{} to notify the technical director of the OGF of any
(proposed) use of a namespace identifier, by contacting \texttt{urn@ogf.org}.
The technical director of the OGF may, at his discretion “reserve” a
subnamespace identifier for a period of maximal one year prior to approval of
an Informational GFD document describing the namespace.

This document does not describe the resolution procedure of any namespace
conflicts.

\label{sec:template}

{
\begin{leftbar}\begin{sloppypar}\noindent
    Example:
}{
\end{sloppypar}\end{leftbar}
}


\subsection*{1. Registration}

\subsubsection*{1.1. Namespace Identifier}

The subnamespace identifier.

\begin{example}
“\texttt{urn:ogf:example:}”
\end{example}

Consideration: This namespace is likely to exist for a prolonged period of
time. Do not include volatile data, such as a working group name
(\texttt{example-wg}), although a name of a protocol is acceptable (e.g.
\texttt{example} for the example-wg working group). \texttt{urn:ogf:} is a
formal namespace, subnamespace identifiers \MUSTNOT{} start with \texttt{x-}.

\subsubsection*{1.2. Document Version}

Registration version number: starting with 1, incrementing by 1 with each new version. \\
Registration date: date of submission of the GFD.

\subsubsection*{1.3. Declared Registrant}

The name and address of the namespace organisation and/or contact person that
is responsible for making the registration.

This section may be omitted if the registrant is the same as the authors of the GFD.

\subsection*{2. Syntax}

\subsubsection*{2.1. Syntactic Structure}

This section should outline any structural features of identifiers in this namespace.  
Is should describe the syntax of all current and future URNs within this namespace that are considered valid.
This description may be used to introduce terminology used in other sections.

\begin{example}
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{EXAMPLE-URN = "urn:ogf:" SNID ":" LOCODE ":" LANDMARK *1(QUERY) *1(FRAGMENT) } \\
  \texttt{SNID = "example"} \\
  \texttt{LOCODE = CC "-" CITY} ; UN location code, http://www.unece.org/locode/ \\
  \texttt{CC = 2( ALPHA )} ; 2-letter country code \\
  \texttt{CITY = 3( ALPHA / DIGIT )} ; UN/LOCODE can contain A-Z and 2-9. \\
  \texttt{LANDMARK = 1*<URN chars>} ; String identifying a landmark \\
  \texttt{QUERY = "?" 1*<URN chars>} \\
  \texttt{FRAGMENT = "\#" 1*<URN chars>}
\end{quote}

Example-URNs that are assigned to a resource \MUST{} contain a UN/LOCODE that
is valid at the time of assignment. URNs must not change, even not when a
UN/LOCODE is changed, and those URNs are still considered valid. Clients
\MAY{} infer from the UN/LOCODE that the landmark is located at the
designated location.

The landmark string may be used for display purposes, but it is opaque:
clients \MUSTNOT{} infer any attributes about the resource being identified
for the \texttt{LANDMARK}.
\end{example}

Consideration: If part of the structure if opaque in meaning (the meaning is not exposed), this should be noted. 
The specification may use the augmented BFR format \cite{rfc5234}.

This section may be combined with section 2.2 or 2.3.

\subsubsection*{2.2. Reserved Use}

This section should outline which of valid URNs \MAY{} be assigned, and which URNs 
\SHOULDNOT{} (yet) be assigned, but are reserved for future use.

\begin{example}
For current assignments, \texttt{LANDMARK} \MUST{} only contain the characters:
\texttt{LANDMARK = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." / "=" / "@" / ";" / "\$" / "\_" / "!" / "*" / "'" / "\%" <hex> <hex>)}.

The \texttt{<URN chars>} may later be expanded with the “\texttt{\&}” and
“\texttt{\~}” characters \cite{rfc2141bis}. These characters \MUSTNOT{} be
used for assignments, but parsers \SHOULD{} be prepared to accept URNs that
contain these characters, as well as the characters “\texttt{:}”
“\texttt{\~}” “\texttt{\&}” and “\texttt{/}”.

The \texttt{QUERY} and \texttt{FRAGMENT} part \MUSTNOT{} be included in
assigned URNs, until it use is documented by a revision of this document.
\end{example}

Considerations: \cite{rfc2141} does not allow query or fragment identifiers,
but the they may be allowed in the future. It is recommended to explicitly
note if query or fragment identifiers are allowed in the namespace.

This section may be combined with section 2.1 or 2.3.

\subsubsection*{2.3. Encoding}

This section should specify the encoding or decoding algorithms. 
This is particularly applicable in the case (a part of) a URN is maps to a 
legacy naming systems.

This section \MUST{} specify if percent-escaping as defined in \cite{rfc2141}
is allowed, and if so, what the binary code represents. This section \MUST{}
specify if the \texttt{<reserved>} characters as defined in \texttt{<URN
chars>} in \cite{rfc2141} are allowed (it is recommended that they are not).

\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{LANDMARK} \MAY{} contain percent-escaped bytes 
    (\texttt{"\%" <hex> <hex>}) as described in \cite{rfc2141}. 
    The percentage-decoded \texttt{LANDMARK} \MUST{} be a valid UTF-8 
    encoded byte sequence, whose characters form a valid NFC-normalised 
    sequence of Unicode characters, defined by Unicode version 2.0 or higher.
    \item The \texttt{LOCODE} \MUST{} map to a valid UN/LOCODE string, 
    with the \texttt{" "} (space) in the UN/LOCODE mapped to a \texttt{"-"} 
    in the LOCODE part of the URN. Since no \texttt{"-"} can occur in the 
    UN/LOCODE, this mapping can be inverted.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

This section may be combined with section 2.1 or 2.2.

\subsubsection*{2.4. Rules for Lexical Equivalence}

This section should list the algorithm for determining lexical equivalence between two identifiers in the underlying namespace.

\begin{example}
URNs are lexical equivalent if and only if they are byte-equivalent after case normalisation.

No interpretation or normalisation of percentage-escaped characters should take place.
\end{example}

Considerations: \cite{rfc2141,draft-dijkstra-urn-ogf} specify that the
\texttt{"urn:ogf:"} part and the SNID are case insensitive and that
hex-encoding in a percentage-escaped character is case insensitive. The
lexical equivalence algorithm defined in this section \MUSTNOT{} violate
these requirements. Typical normalisation functions to consider are case
normalisation, percentage-encoding, diacritical normalisation using canonical
(de)composition (e.g. NFC and NFD in Unicode), and ligature normalisation
using compatibility (de)composition (e.g. NFKC and NFKD in Unicode). If
Unicode normalisation is to occur, the specification should list a specific
Unicode version (e.g. Unicode 2.0 or Unicode 6.0) since this function may
change between versions (e.g. there is no pre-composed character for Y-caron,
but this may be created in future Unicode version).

It is recommended to list a few examples.

\begin{example}
Consider the following URNs (\texttt{"Colossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0"} decodes to “\emph{Colossus Mark I}”):

  1- \texttt{urn:ogf:example:GB-BLE:Colossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0} \\
  2- \texttt{urn:ogf:example:GB-BLE:\%43olossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0} ; \texttt{0x43} is “C” \\
  3- \texttt{urn:ogf:example:gb-ble:colossus\%20mark\%20\%e2\%85\%a0}

Only URN 1 and URN 3 are equivalent to each other.
\end{example}

\subsection*{3. Services}

\subsubsection*{3.1. Validation mechanism}

A URN namespace may provide mechanisms for “validating” a URN -- 
i.e., determining whether a given string is currently a validly-assigned URN.
For example, even if a telephone number-based URN namespace was
created, it is not clear that all telephone numbers would
immediately become “valid” URNs, that could be resolved using
whatever mechanisms are described as part of the namespace
registration.

Where applicable, this section should describe if the operation of 
validation servers is an open process, or that it is subject to 
some authoritative delegation procedure.

Considerations: If such mechanism exists, this section may describe 
this mechanism, or may refer to a document that does describe it.

This section is optional.

\subsubsection*{3.2. Process for identifier resolution}

A URN namespace may provide mechanisms for “resolving” a URN -- 
i.e., determining attributes of the resources that is described, 
such as metadata or the location(s) where the resource can be retrieved.

Where applicable, this section should describe if the operation of 
resolution servers is an open process, or that it is subject to 
some authoritative delegation procedure.

Considerations: If such mechanism exists, this section may describe 
this mechanism, or may refer to a document that does describe it.
This section may contain an estimate of the volatility of the resource 
attributes and a reasonable caching time for these attributes, or 
it could dictate that any resolution mechanism contains caching time-outs.

This section is optional. 

\subsection*{4. Namespace Considerations}

\subsubsection*{4.1. Scope}

This section should outline the scope of the use of the
identifiers in this namespace.  Apart from considerations of
private vs. public namespaces. It is recommended that a namespace 
is limited in scope, to enhance its quality.  For example, a
namespace claiming to deal in "landmarks" should have a global scope 
and address all landmark structures, which is unlikely.
On the other hand, a namespace claiming to deal with only a specific category 
of landmarks, or landmarks in a specific region is more reasonable.

NOTE: It is expected that more than one namespace may serve the same
"functional" purpose; the intent of the "Namespace Considerations"
section is to provide a record of the proposer's "due diligence" in
exploring existing possibilities, for the IESG's consideration.

\begin{example}
The example URN namespace only deals with historic computers that are
considered landmark achievements in computer science. It is limited to
supercomputers that are immobile due to their sheer size.
\end{example}

This section may be combined with section 4.2.

\subsubsection*{4.2. Identifier uniqueness considerations}

This section should address the requirement that URN identifiers
be assigned uniquely -- they are assigned to at most one resource,
and are not reassigned.

This section should address the type of resource to be identified.
The definition of resource is fairly broad. 
For example, for bibliographic records the following resource types exists:
\begin{description}
    \item [work] e.g. Jane Austin's “Gone with the Wind”, or the 
    \item [expression] e.g. the Swedish translation of the work
    \item [manifestation] e.g. a hard cover of the expression
    \item [item] e.g. an actual book on a shelf
\end{description}

In particular, this section should specify if it deals with a general
resource (e.g. “the weather in Seattle”), a particular manifestation or
version (e.g. “the weather in Seattle on May 1st, 2011”) or a dynamic
manifestation (e.g. “the current weather in Seattle”). If desired, the URN
syntax may include a part which specifies the version of the resource (e.g.
\texttt{urn:ogf:example:1943-12-08:GB-BLE:Colossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0})

\begin{example}
Each URN refers to a particular instance of the computer in it's final state.
Replicas and revisions of the original design should receive their own URN.
\end{example}

This section may be combined with section 4.1 or 4.3.

\subsubsection*{4.3. Identifier uniqueness considerations}

This section should include any other considerations dealing with the
uniqueness of URNs in the namespace. Possible considerations include, but are
not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item exposition of the structure of the identifiers, and partitioning 
    of the space of identifiers amongst assignment authorities which are 
    individually responsible for respecting uniqueness rules
    \item identifiers are assigned sequentially
    \item information is withheld; the namespace is opaque
\end{itemize}

This section may be combined with section 4.2.

\subsection*{5. Community Considerations}

\subsubsection*{5.1. Process of identifier assignment}

This section should detail the mechanisms and/or authorities for
assigning URNs to resources.  It should make clear whether
assignment is completely open, or if limited, how to become an
assigner of identifiers, and/or get one assigned by existing
assignment authorities.

Answers could include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item assignment is completely open, following a particular algorithm
    \item assignment is delegated to authorities recognised by a particular organisation
    \item assignment is handled on a per-identifier basis by community consensus (e.g. by publication of a community reviewed Grid Forum Document.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{5.2. Identifier persistence considerations}

The non-reassignment requirement of URN identifiers ensures the persistency 
of a URN after the lifetime of a resource. Despite good intentions, there may 
still be valid reasons for a desire to change a URN identifier:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The prefix contains the name of assigning organisation, and the assigning organisation merges, ceases to exists or changes name.
    \item The identifier contains certain attributes of the resource, and these attributes change.
    \item The resource changes
\end{itemize}

For example, the identifier
\texttt{urn:ogf:example:GB-BLE:Colossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0} contains the
location “Bletchley” in “Great Britain”, as well as the name “Colossus Mark
I” of the resource. GB could be changed to UK; the community of Bletchley
could be annexed by the city of London; it is discovered that the name of the
resource is misspelled; a marketing decision was made to change the name,
etcetera. While these events rarely occur, their occurrence may still be
larger than the anticipated lifetime of the resource identifier, and they
must therefore still be considered.

Considerations: This section should include the considerations why this
particular syntax of the URN is most likely to remain stable, even in the
case of rare events.
It may make a realistic estimate of the lifetime of
the resource, a maximum lifetime of the resource \emph{identifier}, and from
that deduce a minimum time that the resource identifier may not be
re-allocated. This section may explain the organisational requirements how
this minimum time is ensured.

\begin{example}
The Example-URN namespace uses historic names of (super)computers. It is
expected that these names rarely change. No other attributes are part of the
name. To avoid name conflicts, the identifier also includes the location of
the machine, assuming that these machines rarely move location. The location
name at time of commissioning is used, to avoid renaming issues when the
location changes name. If the computer is moved location, either the old
identifier is retained, meaning that the location only infers the name of the
original location, not the name of the current location. It was anticipated
that the location is more stable than the name of the commissioning
organisation. The lifespan of these identifiers may be centuries (e.g. to
describe Charles Babbage's \emph{difference engine}. All identifiers must be
assigned by a central authority, to ensure longtime preservation of the
identifiers.)
\end{example}

\subsection*{6. Examples}

This section may list a few example identifiers.

\begin{example}
The following examples of Example-URNs are informative only. They may not actually exist:

  \texttt{urn:ogf:example:GB-BLE:Colossus\%20Mark\%20\%E2\%85\%A0} \\
  \texttt{urn:ogf:example:US-APG:ENIAC} \\
  \texttt{urn:ogf:example:JP-YOK:Earth\%20Simulator} \\
  \texttt{urn:ogf:example:US-YKH:Watson} \\
\end{example}

\subsection*{7. Relevant ancillary documentation}

This section should list any GFDs, RFCs, standards, or other published
documentation that defines or explains all or part of the
namespace structure.

This section is optional and may be replaced with in-line bibliography references.

\subsection*{8. Changes from Previous Versions / Prior Usage}

This section should include changes to previous versions of the document, 
or list prior (undocumented) use of the namespace.

This section is optional.

\section{Security Considerations}

There are no additional security considerations other than those
normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

Implementors are recommended to check the OGF registry and
documentation \cite{urn-ogf} before assuming that a given identifier is
valid or has a certain meaning.

\section{Glossary}

\begin{description}

  \item[Assigning Organisation] A namespace organisation that assigns unique identifiers to resources.
  
  \item[Cool URI] A URL (!) that is persistent and is used as both a locator and an identifier.

  \item[Fragment Identifier] The part of a URN that follows a pound sign ("\texttt{\#}").

  \item[Globally Unique Identifier] An identifier which identifies at most one resource worldwide. A global identifier typically consists of a prefix and a local identifier.

  \item[Identifier] A label (string or byte sequence) that identifies a resource.

  \item[Locally Unique Identifier] An identifier assigned by an assigning organisation, that identifies at most than one resource.

  \item[Namespace] A set of all possible identifiers with the same namespace identifier.

  \item[Namespace Identifier] A unique identifier of a namespace organisation, often used as a prefix.

  \item[Namespace Organisation] An organisation maintaining a namespace. A namespace organisation may delegate part of their namespace to another namespace organisation.

  \item[Prefix] A namespace identifier, which is prepended to a local identifier to form a globally unique identifier.

  \item[Question Identifier] The part of a URN that follows a question mark ("\texttt{?}").

  \item[Subnamespace Identifier] A word that identifies a part of a a larger namespace. The string "urn:ogf:" followed by a subnamespace identifier forms the prefix of a namespace that is subject of the registration procedure as described in this document.
  
  \item[Unique Identifier] An identifier that identifies at most one resource, and is never re-assigned.

  \item[URL] The location where a resource can be found.

  \item[URN] A globally unique identifier that adheres to the URN syntax described in \cite{rfc2141}.

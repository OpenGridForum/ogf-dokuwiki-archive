Introduction\par }{\par During the last decade there has been a proliferation of information retrieval (IR) implementations and, correspondingly, IR architectures.  The task of the GIR Working Group is to distill the most useful features of existing architectures into a single model that can serve as a common environment for interoperability of existing and future systems.  The most difficult aspect of this, as often is the case in standards processes, is to determine the ideal convergence of ideas in order to avoid a specification that is either too limiting or too broad.  The Working Group (WG) has sought input from many representative communities that implement IR systems, and it has attempted to balance this input with two primary areas of interest: IR research and practical IR interoperability.  These two motivations are the \ldblquote center of gravity\rdblquote  of the present work.\par \par It should be noted at this point that our use of the term, \ldblquote information retrieval,\rdblquote  or \ldblquote IR,\rdblquote  is in the specific sense used by researchers and practitioners of information science, informatics, and computer science.  Specifically, IR is concerned with automated methods of accepting queries from an information seeker and responding with documents that best satisfy the seeker\rquote s information need.  This may include any variety of underlying data structures and data collections, although it is primarily intended for querying unstructured or semi-structured data (such as, for example, free text or XML-encoded text) as opposed to highly structured data (such as relational databases).  GridIR is not an IR implementation per se, but rather an architecture for communities of IR implementations to interoperate within.\par \par We take as a starting point for GridIR certain assumptions about the minimal requirements for a modern IR interoperability standard, and these are detailed in the GridIR requirements document.  There are many features or aspects of an IR system, some related to each other and some independent, and in general too many to approach in a completely organized manner.  The WG has proposed that a GridIR implementation be segmented into three fundamental IR tasks, or functional groups: (1) collecting documents into a local store, (2) indexing or other preparation of the documents, and (3) querying one or more document collections and associated retrieval of search results.  The rest of this document assumes this particular model of a distributed IR system.  Specifically, GridIR defines OGSA services that correspond roughly to each of the three fundamental IR tasks, respectively: (1) the Collection Manager service, (2) the Indexing/Searching service, and (3) the Query Processing service.\par \par }{\b 2. Design Considerations\par }{\par The principal design consideration of this particular approach to IR interoperability is a recognition of the \ldblquote monolithic\rdblquote  character of most existing IR implementations and a desire to enable greater modularity in future IR systems.  One of the primary motivations of GridIR is a concern that IR systems are becoming too complicated, massive, and eclectic for monolithic implementation.  In addition, there is an increasing need for both \ldblquote on demand\rdblquote  and event-driven information sharing, and thus for IR systems to be able to work together intimately.  Another reason for modularizing these systems is that one size does }{\i not}{ fit all when it comes to IR.  While a monolithic web search engine may be ideal for web searching, its limitations become evident when one would like to search data collections other than, or in addition to, the web.  Finally, a successful federated IR implementation would significantly increase available processing power, since current monolithic systems are restricted by the need to provide instant response to queries of extremely large data collections.\par \par It is also necessary to consider in the design of GridIR the scalability of interactions over a network in much the same way that this would need to be considered in a more traditional distributed system.\par \par An important design consideration is security throughout the system.  OGSA provides a degree of authentication and authorization as part of the virtual organization model, but it is necessary for GridIR to have its own implementation of service-level access control.  It is an essential feature of GridIR that each component within a virtual GridIR organization be permitted a fine degree of resource control.  This model combined with a distributed architecture can enable greater sharing of semi-public information among organizations by supporting their highly customized access constraints.  This is one of the goals of GridIR.\par \par }{\b 3. Architecture and Terminology\par }{\par This section provides an overview of the GridIR components (i.e. services) and the relationships among them.  Note that these services may or may not be distributed among different servers; GridIR does not require any particular organization or distribution of services.\par \par The Collection Manager service (CM) is concerned with collecting and managing source documents intended to be indexed, searched, and retrieved via one or more GridIR systems.  It does this by retrieving specified documents from various locations (remote or local), preprocessing and managing them in a local store, and providing them to clients according to specified rules.  \ldblquote Client\rdblquote  here normally refers to the Indexing/Searching service, which uses CM\rquote s as the sources of documents that will be indexed and searched.  Any CM can be requested to monitor its sources for updates and/or provide notification to Indexing/Searching services when updates are available.  In essence, the CM acts as a virtual document collection that feeds one or more Indexing/Searching services.  At the same time, an Indexing/Searching service may retrieve documents from one or more CM\rquote s.\par \par The Indexing/Searching service (IS) is therefore not troubled with the need to assemble documents from the variety of existing sources; the CM takes care of that.  The documents are provided to the IS, and there the real work of indexing and/or otherwise preparing the documents begins.  The IS creates and manages data structures needed to provide searching capabilities.  (These data structures are normally referred to as an \ldblquote index.\rdblquote )  The IS also exposes a \ldblquote search interface,\rdblquote  which is a set of functions that allow searching of the indexed document collection.  We choose to name this particular group of functions because the Query Processing service also provides these functions, which means that queries through the search interface are supported by both the IS and the Query Processing service.  IS represents the core features of a traditional IR system.  It accepts documents, indexes them, and provides searching capabilities on those documents.  Furthermore it provides a common search interface, which is comparable to traditional IR standards such as Z39.50.  The CM adds to this a distributed document collection and event-driven updates.  The Query Processing service distributes the searching side of the IR system.\line \par The Query Processor service (QP), the third architectural component of GridIR, is responsible for managing queries and result sets (i.e. response sets from searching operations).  It may preprocess a query before submitting it to an IS, for example, performing thesaurus expansion on the query.  It may submit the query to more than one IS, in which case it is also concerned with merging result sets from those IS\rquote s.\par \par As mentioned earlier, QP provides a search interface identical to that of IS.  In other words, for purposes of searching, QP is a \ldblquote virtual IS.\rdblquote   It has no indexing capability of its own (and provides no indexing interface) but serves as a search-only gateway to one or more IS\rquote s.  It is not our intention that a QP implementation have any searching capability of its own; however, since the search interface exists, it is possible to serve a locally indexed collection via QP.  But it is preferable that such a system be served via an IS interface, even if no indexing functions are provided through GridIR.  Hopefully it is clear that a typical use of QP\rquote s would be to act as a primary interface to a collection of IS\rquote s and CM\rquote s that can be managed dynamically and independently of the QP\rquote s.  The QP\rquote s may be the only access points, or it may also be possible to access the individual IS\rquote s and CM\rquote s.  The important concept is that any arrangement of CM\rquote s, IS\rquote s, and QP\rquote s is only one of potentially multiple virtual GridIR organizations.\par \par All of these services include a function called, \ldblquote Explain.\rdblquote   (The term is borrowed from Z39.50.)  Explain provides metadata about a service, such as the supported capabilities of a particular service instance, the type of content available, etc.  For example, IS provides information about (1) what document collections are available for searching, (2) which subset of searching capabilities are supported, (3) what metadata elements are directly searchable, etc.  All such information are accessed via the Explain function.\par \par In general, the interactions among components are asynchronous, and both the management/update and searching of a GridIR system may be performed entirely through event-driven notification.\par  \par }{\b 4. Components and Interfaces\par }{\par This section provides further detail about the GridIR services and their function interfaces.\par  \par }\pard\plain \s4\keepn\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel3\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \i\f4\lang1033\cgrid {Collection Manager service\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \f4\lang1033\cgrid {\par The CM may be considered as a black box with its main input and output consisting of documents.  It brings documents into its local store and sends them off, usually to one or more IS components for indexing (but potentially to other CM components).  Both the input and output interactions are controlled by \ldblquote configuring\rdblquote  the CM with a set of rules.\par \par This configuration is not necessarily done by the local system administrator, but by the authorized \ldblquote administrator\rdblquote  of the GridIR system, and it is performed via GridIR function calls of the CM service.  It could also be done by a \ldblquote client\rdblquote  component (and again, we mean an IS component); for example, an IS implementation could create a CM instance, or communicate with an existing one, and \ldblquote configure\rdblquote  that CM itself.  This is what we mean by configuration of GridIR services, and for that reason it is not clear whether the traditional separation of \ldblquote administrator\rdblquote  and \ldblquote user\rdblquote  applies very well to a Grid-based distributed system such as GridIR.  It is not only possible but desirable that \ldblquote users\rdblquote  be able to create and augment IR systems within the GridIR model, and the granularity of that control may vary depending on the virtual organization.\par \par The \ldblquote input\rdblquote  of documents into a CM is generally a process of harvesting those documents from a remote server, often via a TCP/IP protocol such as HTTP or FTP.  However, the documents may also be sent to the CM as events, as in the case of a news feed, for example.  The CM may also perform searches on QP or IS nodes and retrieve documents designated by the result sets (or via the \ldblquote standing query\rdblquote  function of QP).  The CM is typically configured to harvest documents from specific servers (e.g. by URL), and optionally to check for updates on a regular schedule.  The documents may be considered for retrieval according to certain criteria, with only conforming documents being selected; again this is specified as part of the configuration.\par \par The \ldblquote output\rdblquote  of documents from a CM to a client can be requested by the client or provided to the client as part of an event.  This also is specified by configuration.  If the CM is configured to \ldblquote push\rdblquote  the documents to a client under certain circumstances, it will do so by sending notification to the client that new documents are available.  \ldblquote Under certain circumstances\rdblquote  means that the CM has received document updates, or the client has requested notification on a time schedule, or some other internal or external event has occurred that is understood by the CM implementation.  Notification is performed using the underlying notification capability of OGSA.\par \par }\pard\plain \s4\keepn\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel3\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \i\f4\lang1033\cgrid {Indexing/Searching service\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \f4\lang1033\cgrid {\par The IS component is of course concerned with indexing and searching.  The implementations of these two functions are very closely coupled; however, they are architecturally rather distinct and easy to separate.  The inclusion of an indexing function in GridIR is fairly novel for an IR standard, and the approach we have taken to the indexing interface is based on the common implementation experience of the WG.  The most significant feature of the indexing architecture is the distributing of the document collection to one or more CM components.  Since some preprocessing or normalization can occur in the CM, the task of managing a variety of input documents and document sources in the IS may be reduced.\par \par However, the IS component is still the heaviest of the GridIR services, with the most implementation complexity, the richest set of functions, and the largest number of combinations in which its functions may be used.  For this reason, the most architecturally significant features of GridIR are located in the CM and QP components, in order to distribute the overall complexity of implementation.\par \par The IS indexing function is configured in the same way that CM is configured, with its relationship to CM being the only source of documents understood within the scope of GridIR.  IS may \ldblquote poll\rdblquote  one or more CM\rquote s for documents and document updates, and/or it may receive notification of documents and document updates from one or more CM\rquote s.  In either case, the IS can notify one or more specified QP\rquote s that the collection has changed, once its local index has been updated to reflect the changes.  (That event might, for example, cause the QP to reissue a \ldblquote standing query\rdblquote  and update its result set.)  Other indexing features are specified in the configuration, such as re-indexing schedule, document types, indexing options, and metadata elements to be indexed.  The IS organizes indexed document collections into groups which we call \ldblquote databases.\rdblquote   The databases may be searched individually or in combination.  The list of databases available for searching as well as associated metadata are retrieved prior to searching via the Explain function.\par \par The IS search interface is based on the Z39.50 IR standard (ANSI/NISO Z39.50, ISO 23950).\par \par }\pard\plain \s4\keepn\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\outlinelevel3\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \i\f4\lang1033\cgrid {Query Processing service\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \f4\lang1033\cgrid {\par The QP is a point of entry for a client wishing to search a GridIR system.  It can represent a single IS or many IS components.  The client can be a user client or another service, such as another QP.\par \par As mentioned earlier, QP and IS share the same search interface.  The main significance of this is that whenever we say that a QP queries or otherwise relates to an IS, the IS could in reality be either IS or another QP.  QP is not concerned about whether it is a client of IS or QP, since both have an identical interface for purposes of searching.  This allows distributed searching networks to be set up dynamically, by creating (normally) only a single QP.  This is a flexible compromise between the traditional static model of distributed searching, in which one searches through a fixed entry point, and the Z39.50 model, which places all responsibility for the distributed search on the user client.  Either approach could be implemented using the GridIR services, depending on the IR system requirements.\par \par QP is dedicated to searching, and especially distributed searching.  Its main purpose is to manage the processing and distribution of queries to multiple IS nodes and to reduce the responses into a single result set.  It also issues distributed calls to the Explain function and merges those results to provide a single Explain response for its clients; which of course normally occurs before one begins issuing queries.  Thus, from the point of view of a client interested in searching existing IR systems, QP is not very much different from IS.  The real work occurs between QP and the IS/QP components to which it distributes queries and from which it merges results.\par \par QP can optionally be configured to manage a \ldblquote standing query,\rdblquote  by which we mean a query that is automatically reissued to an IS (on a schedule, or in the event of changes to the collection, or on the basis of some other criteria).  If a standing query detects changes in the result set, it will notify the user client.  This can also be used to implement \ldblquote filtering,\rdblquote  an IR concept in which a fixed query is applied to a stream of documents and a Boolean relevance judgment is made for each document as being either \ldblquote relevant\rdblquote  or \ldblquote not relevant.\rdblquote \par \par We should note that documents themselves are not handled by QP or the search interface of IS.  The search interface of both QP and IS return references to the documents, and in order to retrieve the documents, the client must either communicate with the CM that provided the documents or retrieve the documents directly via URL.  The CM\rquote s and/or URL\rquote s needed for this purpose are included in the result sets.\par \par }{\b 5. Sample Use\par }{\par This section describes a sample usage scenario of GridIR, in order to explain how the architecture could be applied.\par \par Gnewes Inc., a large news-gathering corporation, decides to expose a subset of its documents to external use via GridIR.  To avoid possible abuse, they require registration before allowing access to their CM.  Other organizations, once they have registered, can connect their IS or QP components to the CM.  Gnewes Inc. might also run an IS or QP.\par \par The virtual organizations (VO\rquote s) consist of two members: one is Gnewes Inc. and the other is a registered organization.  Larger VO\rquote s could be created if registered organizations wish to join together, but otherwise the VO\rquote s exist in pairs because there is no requirement by Gnewes Inc. that the registered organizations be part of the same VO.  (For example, the registered organizations might be competitors.)\par \par The registered organizations can then build up IS nodes or set up QP\rquote s and make their own decisions about who else can join in the VO\rquote s for those QP/IS groups.  An end-user interested in searching the contents of Gnewes Inc. could set up his or her own QP that would connect to one of the registered organizations\rquote  IS nodes.\par \par When a \ldblquote hit\rdblquote  (i.e. document citation) is found by the user, he or she would select a document for viewing.  The request would either go directly to Gnewes Inc. (if the user is part of Gnewes\rquote  VO) or to the registered organization\rquote s IS node, which would forward the request to Gnewes Inc.  In both cases, Gnewes\rquote  CM would decide whether to provide the document, based on its access control list.\par \par }{\b 6. Security Considerations\par }{\par The current security model in GridIR proposes a fourth service, the Security service.  This service is responsible for managing all access control not handled by OGSA at the virtual organization level.  Specifically it maintains access control lists for a set of GridIR services that have been registered with the Security service, and it provides access control information as requested by each of those services.\par \par Grid security is still evolving.  At the time of writing, it is not yet clear whether consolidating this function into a service as proposed is the best solution.  An alternative would be to provide access control functions in each of the three fundamental GridIR services, much as Explain is provided.\par \par }{\b 7.

Abstract

    In evaluating Grid technology for production use, several members of
    the DOE Science Grid community feel there is a need for another
    class of certificates to be used for authenticating automated
    clients that connect to Grid servers. The usage of these new
    certificates is different enough so that current CA certificate
    policies will need to be updated.



1.  Introduction

    Current DOE Science Grid (DOESG) and European Data Grid (EDG)
    certificate policies cover issuing x509 certificates for individual
    identities and for authenticating hosts and services. In evaluating
    Grid technology for production use, several members of the DOESG
    community feel there is a need for another class of certificates to
    be used for authenticating automated clients that connect to Grid
    servers. The usage of these new certificates is different enough so
    that current ceritificate policies will need to be updated.

    We propose that a new namespace branch, differentiated by an
    "OU=robots" Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), be created that can
    be used to distinguished certificates used for automated processes.
    In addition, we propose that specific extensions be added to the
    certificate to identify responsible parties and legitimate source
    domains. In terms of policy, we recommend that sites that wish to
    use automated certificates publish a policy statement describing how
    they intend to use and manage these certificates so that RA's and

    resource providers can make informed trust decisions.


2.  Motivation

    One of the major differences between a production environment and a
    research environment is in procedure: production environments
    typically have a large collection of procedures that are used to
    maintain "production quality", examples are service monitoring
    systems, backup systems and various housecleaning utilities.
    Production environments also typically support repetitive, ongoing
    processes - either internal system processes or processes relating
    to the applications being run at the site, for example, processes
    that move datasets from one site to another.

    These procedures and repetitive processes are typically automated,
    run across multiple machines, and generally run using an identity
    with the necessary privileges to perform their tasks, and little
    else. As Grid technology is put into production, we are finding that
    we need to perform the same kind of repetitive, automated tasks, but
    using Grid credentials over Grid services. However, there does not
    seem to be any allowance within the DOESG and EDG certificate
    policies for issuing certificates to support these kinds of tasks.


3.  Discussion

    Currently, 2 classes of certificates are issued:


    Personal identity certificates
          These are used to identify individuals, and have the
          "OU=people" attribute in their subject distinguished names.
          Typically, these certificates are used to authenticate the
          client side of a client/server request, and the certificate
          must be on any machine from which a client request could
          originate. The private key is supposed to be while stored
          encrypted, and user action is required to generate a proxy
          certificate based on the key. The accountable party is the
          individual identified on the certificate.


    Host/Service certificates
          These are used to authenticate a host, or a server running on
          the host, and generally have the "OU=services" attribute in
          their subject distinguished names. These certs are generally
          used to authenticate servers to clients, and are uniquely
          located on that machine. There is usually no reason for a



Chan & Crawford                                                 [Page 2]

GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


          client connecting to a server to present an "OU=services"
          certificate (for example, you would not expect to see such a
          cert in a grid-mapfile). The private key is stored
          unencrypted, and is used "as-is," without generating a proxy
          certificate. The accountable party is nominally the individual
          that submitted the certificate signing request, but in fact it
          is the IT group that maintains the machine or service
          identified on the certificate.

    A certificate for an automated client has attributes that span both
    these types of certificates:

    1)  The private key needs to be stored unencrypted so that automated
        tools can use it. This is similar to a service's credential.

    2)  The certificate may be used to generate proxy certificates, and
        is used to authenticate the initiator of a connection. One could
        reasonably expect to see the subject names of these certificates
        in a grid-mapfile, as you would a personal identity certificate.

    3)  The accountable party may not be clearly identifiable in the Sub
        ject Distinguished Name in the certificate, but might nominally
        be the person submitting the certificate signing request.
        However, the true accountable party would be the group that
        operates the automated client. This is similar to a service.

    4)  Many of these automated clients do the same task from multiple
        machines. For example, automated backup clients all do
        essentially the same task, and usually run as the same
        restricted identity across multiple machines. For data
        replication clients, the replication service may operate from
        multiple machines. Getting and managing multiple certificates
        for a small number of machines is annoying, getting and managing
        certificates for hundreds of machines (such as the typical HENP
        cluster) becomes problematic. IT staff may be inclined to reuse
        the same certificate on multiple hosts. If this is not
        acceptable practice, there needs to be some mechanism to prevent
        or detect it.

    Because these certificates are neither fish nor fowl in the current
    model, there needs to be clarification on how they can acceptably be
    handled. Another set of use cases that hasn't been discussed, but
    are related, is authentication of peer to peer services.

    The discussion on the DOESG mailing list also seemed to identify
    these main issues:

    Identity/accountability -- who exactly would be accountable for


Chan & Crawford                                                 [Page 3]
GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


    these certs? The correct answer from the perspective of an
    organization is that an IT group would be accountable for the
    certificate. Individuals within an IT group may share or change
    responsibilities, and turnover is not unheard of - at which point,
    the certificate will no longer accurately reflect the accountable
    party (arguably, it may never have in the first place). In a
    managed, production environment, an organizational abstraction is
    the actual accountable party, and not an individual. However it
    might be argued that assigning accountability to an abstraction
    dilutes accountability.

    Shared certificates -- the notion of sharing the certificate across
    multiple machines increases the potential damage from a compromised
    private key. However, this same form of risk is managed on a daily
    basis by IT groups that have standard passwords for system accounts
    (such as root). The exposure is contained by the fact that there is
    a de facto trust boundary at the site perimeter - no machine managed
    by another group shares the same "root" password. If shared
    certificates were issued, it would be wise to ensure that all
    machines that trust that certificate are under the same
    administrative domain.


4.  Analog from existing practice

    Kerberos is already used by automated clients at many sites. To
    explore the problem space, we examine the practice at one such site,
    Fermilab.

    Service principals are used directly as clients when it is the
    service itself that is acting as the client of another service. For
    example, when a mass storage systems initiates a transfer to or from
    another mass storage system, it identifies itself as the same name
    by which it's known to clients.

    When the automated process initiating a connection isn't a known
    service itself, it uses what's known at this site as a "project
    principal." The name of such a principal has three components
    (besides the realm) which identify its function, the responsible
    organizational unit, and the single host from which it is expected
    to authenticate itself. For example,
    "level3/cdf/b0dax42.fnal.gov@FNAL.GOV" acts as part of the Level-3
    trigger for the CDF experiment, and authenticates using a keytab
    file (analogous to the private key corresponding to a certificate)
    stored on the host b0dax42.fnal.gov. Since a Kerberos initiator must
    first communicate with the KDC to obtain credentials, the KDC has a
    record of where the authentication requests for this principal come
    from and, to the extent that DNS can be relied upon, may reject



Chan & Crawford                                                 [Page 4]
GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


    requests from elsewhere than that one host or raise an audit flag
    for them.

    A large class of automated client requests are performing actions
    for a specific user, generally through the unix "cron" scheduled
    execution facility. Fermilab users have the ability to create and
    destroy per-user, per-host principals for themselves with names of
    the form username/cron/hostname@FNAL.GOV and to create a keytab file
    on the corresponding host. Tying each such principal to a host and a
    user facilitates recovery from any security incident involving the
    user or the host.


5.  Proposals

    One of the most basic, and probably least controversial proposals is
    to create a separate namespace for this new class of certificates.
    Reusing service certificates sets up a precedent of having "server
    side" certificates suddenly become client side proxy certificates,
    and makes it harder to clearly identify misuse of certificates.
    Using personal certificates for these services requires that
    individuals expose their personal certificates to theft because the
    private key is stored in the clear (or stored together with its
    decryption key). This is especially dangerous for administrators,
    whose personal accounts may contain sensitive information and or
    privileges. In addition, it is generally desired that these
    automated client identities accounts map onto severely restricted
    local accounts, instead of a normal user account.

    We propose that a new namespace branch be created, alongside the
    customary "OU=People" and "OU=Services," differentiated by an
    "OU=robots" RDN. The commonName RDN(s) in such names shall include a
    descriptive name for the automated function. This function should be
    specific, similar to "CN=NERSC backuprobot" for a NERSC client used
    to perform backups, or "CN=ATLAS filereplicator" for a process that
    performs file replication for the ATLAS collaboration. When
    possible, the fully-qualified domain name of the host that holds the
    private key shall appear in another commonName RDN.

    The descriptive name RDNs are purely informational, although
    Registration Agents or CAs should deny certificate requests that
    they deem to be too generic or insufficiently descriptive.

    In addition, all such certificates must include a SubjectAltName
    extension. If non-critical, it simply provides contact information
    for the party responsible for the actions of the automated function.
    The automated process identified by the certificate is considered to
    be an agent of the party identified in the SubjectAltname.



Chan & Crawford                                                 [Page 5]
GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


    The contact information must lead to members of formal organizations
    that operate datacenters with a clearly identified systems
    administration staff, or members of a multi-institutional
    collaboration, vetted by a principal investigator or spokesperson. A
    minimum of one rfc822Name within the SubjectAltName extension is
    strongly recommended.

    Including a critical SubjectAltName extension is experimental.  Such
    a critical extension should contain, in addition to the contact
    information, one or more iPAddress and/or dNSName elements and
    relying parties are requested to accept the credential only when
    presented from a peer on one of those addresses or hosts. (But see
    Security Considerations below.)

    Parties that request these certificates must publish a policy
    statement that describes how the certificates will be used, who will
    have access to the private key and what measures will be used to
    ensure the security of these certificates at their site. This
    document must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate
    certificate authority bodies before certificates will be signed.


5.1.  Alternatives

    The more controversial proposals would include somehow altering the
    policies to make allowance for the notion that "permanent" IT groups
    (as opposed to ad hoc virtual organizations) can be accountable
    parties. Possibly the most controversial is how to handle the notion
    certificates with shared access to the private key. This is a
    convenience for IT organizations and is a fact of life for almost
    all service credentials. But when considering automated processes as
    initiators of Grid activities, the security of their credentials
    needs to be approached with caution.

    None of the proposed changes can be effected unilaterally, and we
    also believe that the issues are of concern to European Data Grid
    users as well as the DOE Science Grid users. In fact, it will likely
    be a concern for all large Certificate Authorities, and the
    situation provides an opportunity for the DOESG and EDG to exercise
    leadership in setting standards for how these certificates can be
    handled.


6.  Security Considerations

    Three main security considerations have come out of discussions:





Chan & Crawford                                                 [Page 6]
GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


6.1.  Accountability

    How do we identify a responsible party for the robot certificate?
    This is addressed by the required SubjectAltName component -
    verification of the SubjectAltName is handled by the RA using
    standard methods. In addition, the policy statement is another
    aspect of accountability. By publicly stating the manner in which
    the certificates can be used, as well as providing contact
    information for a responsible individual, we believe that an
    acceptable standard of accountability can be maintained.


6.2.  Misuse

    This is an important consideration. In fact, the ability to
    partition off automated client certificates into a separate
    namespace allows resource providers finer grained access control,
    which has the potential to curb misuse. In addition, the
    ValidDomains attribute and the descriptive Common Name attribute
    serve to identify legitimate uses for the client certificates. If
    normal user certificates or host certificates were used, it would be
    harder to distinguish either legitimate uses (for host certificates)
    or legitimate client machines (for user certificates).


6.3.  Proper Management of Client Certificates

    This is a legitimate concern, and is the motivation behind the
    policy statement required of all parties that request automated
    client certificates. Ultimately, proper handling depends on the
    professionalism of the staff managing the certificates - there is no
    clear legalistic method to verify this, so this depends initially on
    the registration authority's confidence in the policy statements of
    the certificate requestor, and subsequently on the authorization
    decisions of the resource provider.

    Arguably, the security of any certificate is only as good as the
    people who handle them. Production operations staff have been
    operating system accounts for decades (for example: "root" in Unix),
    and a strong case can be made that such groups have legitimate uses
    for automated client certificates, as well as the professional
    experience to management them securely. With the arrival of finer
    grained authorization for Globus services, the security of single
    purpose client certificates can be further enforced by technical
    means. Partitioning off a new namespace only simplifies the
    application of these authorization tools, thus increasing security.

GGF Draft                   Automated Clients             9 October 2003


6.4.  Other security considerations

    Attempting to restrict the source hostname or address from which a
    credential may be used by means of a critical SubjectAltName
    extension is only a weak security measure, since addresses can be
    spoofed and DNS is generally insecure.


    Storing a single private key on multiple systems is to be avoided if
    at all possible, and multiple automated clients performing similar
    or connected functions should have separate Subject Distinguished
    Names.  Preferably those names will identify the host on which the
    unique instance of the associated private key resides.

    Finally, as with service private keys, care must be taken to prevent
    the private key from being accessible to unauthorized parties
    through system backup media.

Comments on the document:

I only have minor issues with this document which have been noted below.
However, since this document has been in the pipeline for so long, I
recommend to forward this document to the editor and public comment
period anyhow, and have these modifications fixed after the public
comment period is finished.


Meta-level
 - Fix the document file name (draft-ggf-caops-pmacharter-XX.pdf)
 - The type should be GWD-C for now (GFD-C after approval)
 - Overall style issue: I understand that this document is a community
   practice document. Yet I believe that use of MAY and SHOULD could be
   used to indicate your thoughts on the relative importance of the
   various practices and processes listed in the document. Currently,
   you deliberately avoid use of should and may and instead use
   variants like "In this section you should describe X" vs "This
   section will describe X" vs "This section describes X" vs "Specify
   X". At least be consistent! 

Abstract
 - Missing dot after [GPMA]
 - Style issue: abbreviation are put in brackets [] which to me means a
   reference. Parentheses () would be better.
 - "Certificate Authorities" -> "Certification Authorities"

1. Overview
 - What fundamentally distinguishes a GCA from a CA? Does that mean that
   the same CA cannot be used in some other non-Grid, non-relevant domain?
   Defining the term seems like an overkill to me: the point is to
   harmonize the requirements set forth in various CPSes, not to define
   the purpose of a CA's existence in first place. Or am I wrong?

2. Introduction
 - Style issue: use of "you"

3. Scope
 - 2nd sentence: remove ' in GPKI's
 - 2nd to last sentence before 3.1: remove s in PMAs

4.1 Initial membership
 - When does the interoperable PKI become a GPKI? Is there any use in
   keeping two names around for the same thing? What's so special for
   a GPKI vs any "normal" PKI that stretch across organizational
   boundaries?
 - 

6 Responsibilities
 - Overall: This section is not an easy read. Short sentences and a
   mix of style, also all of sudden you assume a PMA is not necessarily
   governing GPKIs. Suggest rephrasing.
 - 5th row from top: remove ' in GPKI's
 - "Audits": why capitalized A?

6.1 CP/CPS
 - CRL abbreviation not described

6.2 Other documents
 - remove ' in CA's

6.3 Audit
 - GCA and GPKI -> GCAs and GPKIs (?)
 - remove ' in CA's
 
6.5 Directory
 - on directory -> on one or several directories
 - mechanisms, which -> mechanims as
 - IETF pkix WG -> IETF PKIX WG

7.2 Meetings
 - Are the meetings and minutes open for public access and scrutiny?
   The document sort of infers this but it is not explicitly pointed
   out.

7.4 Decision - making process
 - Could be the header style making it, but it looks like there are
   spaces around the dash in "decision-making".

8. Bylaws
 - Spelling: bylaws or by-laws? Use of both variants is used
   throughout the document.

9. Security
 - Non-concluded sentence at the end: "On the other hand, the more
   open the process is, the"

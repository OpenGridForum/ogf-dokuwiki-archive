There are no human names here and RNS has no use.

EPIs can be communicated in many ways and live forever - they can be embedded in EPRs, but can also be communicated through queries, emails or pigeons.

Assume that I have an EPI-1 that was issued for a certain resource and the resolution info was maintained in resolution server R-1, and an
EPI-2 issued for another resource and that resolution info was maintained in resolution server R-2.
Then it is discovered that those two resource "are" the same identical resource It is then decided that the resource's resolution&meta-data info is consolidated and maintained in one location only, say R-2. Furthermore, after the consolidation policy will be expressed on EPI-2 only.
When a global naming system is used for EPI-1, like dns/lsid/handle, then that EPI-1 will always be bound to resolution server R-1.
In such cases, one would want R-1 to resolve to the new EPI-2 as a referral to the EPI where the current resolution/metadata is maintained.

R-1 could potentially return a ReferenceResolver-EPR instead, which would refer to the EPI-2 entry at R-2, and this would be allowed by the current spec.

Semantically there is no difference between returning a referral through an alias-EPI or a referral through a ReferenceResolver, and it is a choice of the deployed naming server implementation which one makes sense.

Therefor there shouldn't be any objection to the suggested enhancement especially when a real use case is identified.

Not sure where we state that an EPI should be "location independent"...
or not even sure what that means in your context.

The spec should not rely on any specific resolver information embedded in an EPI, but it should neither exclude any use of such information.

We have chosen the URI format for our EPIs for a reason (at least I
have...) as it allows the client applications to find the right resolver. Your suggestion that a client can use "any resolver to attempt to resolve the name" doesn't sound very efficient.  Our implementation will make use of the fact that those EPIs are URIs, and the first dispatching will be based on the URI-schema to find the right resolver (uuid:/http:/dns:/lsid:/hdl:). Then depending on available schema-specific handlers, one could associate resolver servers with naming authorities. All those are "optimizations" that make sense if we use real globally resolvable naming schema and I sure hope that we will not cripple our spec to make it impossible to use those strategies.

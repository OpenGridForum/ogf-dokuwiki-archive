<p>The DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) Infrastructure is an approach to the management of systems and networks that applies the basic structuring and conceptualization techniques of the object-oriented paradigm. The approach uses a uniform modeling formalism that together with the basic repertoire of object-oriented constructs supports the cooperative development of an object-oriented schema across multiple organizations. This document describes an object-oriented meta model based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This model includes expressions for common elements that must be clearly presented to management applications (for example, object classes, properties, methods and associations).
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="CommonInformationModel.html">CIM Schema	v2.9</a> 
</p>
<p>The Common Information Model (CIM) is conceptual information model for describing computing and business entities in internet, enterprise and service provider environments. It provides a consistent definition and structure of data , using object oriented techniques. The CIM includes expressions for common elements that must be clearly presented to management applications like object classes, properties, methods and associations to name a few. CIM uses a set of terminology specific to the model and the principles of object oriented programming. The standard language used to define elements of CIM is Managed Object Format (MOF).

<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="DSP0214.html">DSP0214</a> Server Management Command Line Protocol Specification (SM CLP)  V1.0
</p>
<p>The principal goal of this specification is to define a light-weight, human-oriented command line
protocol which is also suitable for scripting environments. This includes a direct mapping to a
subset of the CIM Schema. The command line protocol will specify the syntax and semantics
used to allow the manipulation of the Managed Elements and Associations within servers, as
collections or individually.

<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ConfigurationDescriptionDeploymentAndLifecycleManagementCDDLMFoundationDocument1.html">Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management (CDDLM) Foundation Document 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>This document provides a high level overview of the CDDLM space by
describing requirements, analyzing use cases, and by providing an
overview of the related work within GGF, other standard bodies, as
well as in industry and academia in general. The document sets the
stage for the follow-up documents that will present in more detail the
language, component model, and basic CDDLM services.
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ConfigurationDescriptionDeploymentAndLifecycleManagementSmartFrogBasedLanguageSpecification1.html">Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management, SmartFrog-Based Language Specification 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>The SmartFrog Language spec describes a language primarily intended
for configuration description and deployment. It is declarative,
i.e. it supports attribute value pairs. Furthermore, it supports
inheritance, references (including lazy), parameterization, predicates
and schemas. It has the same functionality as CDL (see next
paragraph), except that it is not XML-based. SmartFrog language
predates CDL and it was used as a model when creating CDL. The two
languages will be compatible. CDL is primarily intended for machines,
SmartFrog for humans.
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ConfigurationDescriptionDeploymentAndLifecycleManagementXMLBasedLanguageSpecification1.html">Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management, XML-Based Language Specification 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>The CDDLM Configuration Description Language (CDL) is an XML-based
language for declarative description of system configuration that
consists of components (deployment objects) defined in the CDDLM
Component Model. The language provides ways to describe properties
(names, values, and types) of components including value references so
that data can be assigned dynamically with preserving specified data
dependencies. A system is described as a hierarchical structure of
components. The language also provides prototype-based template
functionality (i.e., prototype references) so that the user can
describe a system by referring to component descriptions given by
component providers.
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ConfigurationDescriptionDeploymentAndLifecycleManagementCompornentModelSpecification1.html">Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management, Compornent Model Specification 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>The CDDLM Component Model outlines the requirements for creating a
deployment object responsible for the lifecycle of a deployed
resource. Each deployment object is defined using the CDL language and
mapped to its implementation. The deployment object provides a
WSResourceFramework (WSRF) compliant &quot;Component Endpoint&quot; for
lifecycle operations on the managed resource. The model also defines
the rules for managing the interaction of objects with the CDDLM
Deployment API in order to provide an aggregate, controllable
lifecycle and the operations which enable this process.
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ConfigurationDescriptionDeploymentAndLifecycleManagementDeploymentAPISpecification1.html">Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management, Deployment API Specification	1.0</a>
</p>
<p>The deployment API is the WSRF-based SOAP API for deploying
applications to one or more target computers. Every set of computers
to which systems can be deployed hosts one or more &quot;Portal Endpoints&quot;,
WSRF resources which provide a means to create new &quot;System
Endpoints&quot;. A System Endpoint represents a deployed system. The caller
can upload files to it, then submit a deployment descriptor for
deployment.  A System Endpoint is effectively a component in terms of
the Component Model specification it implements the properties and
operations defined in that document. It also adds the ability to
resolve references within the deployed system, enabling remote callers
to examine the state of components with it.

<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="ApplicationContentsServiceSpecification1.html">Application Contents Service Specification 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>In order to install and operate complex systems such as n-tier systems
more efficiently and automatically, it is necessary to specify and
manage, as a unit, a diverse set of application related
information. The Application Contents Service (ACS) provides central
management of such application information.  The Application Contents
Service specification will focus on two main topics: a) Application
Repository Interface (ARI), specifying repository service and its
interface to Application Contents; and b) Application Archive Format
(AAF), specifying archive format to register a set of Application
Contents to the ACS as a unit. The Application Contents include
application binaries and related information; e.g. program binaries,
configuration data, procedure descriptions for lifecycle management,
requirements descriptions for the hardware and underlying middleware,
policy rules, and anything needed to create a task on grid systems.

<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="JobSubmissionInformationModelJSIM1.html">Job Submission Information Model (JSIM) 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>This document describes the Job Submission Interface Model. It is
based on the &quot;job&quot; schema in DMTF's Common Information Model (CIM),
version 2.8. It includes a UML diagram of the classes associated with
job submission, the managed object format (MOF) for those classes, and
an XML representation of the UML.
</p>
<p>	<a class="wikipage" href="WebServicesAgreementSpecificationWSAgreement1.html">Web Services Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) 1.0</a>
</p>
<p>This document describes Web Services Agreement Specification
(WS-Agreement), an XML language for specifying an agreement between a
resource/service provider and a consumer, and a protocol for creation
of an agreement using agreement templates. The specification consists
of three parts to be used in a composable manner: a schema for
specifying an agreement, a schema for specifying an agreement
template, and a set of port types and operations for managing
agreement life-cycle, including creation, termination, and monitoring
of agreement states.

<h3 id='section-HomePage-SMIStructureOfManagementInformationVersion2InternetStandardSTD58'><a class="wikipage" href="SMI.html">SMI</a> - Structure of Management Information Version 2 (Internet Standard: STD 58)</h3>
<p>   The SMIv2 is the Data Modeling language used for writing MIB module specifications.
   The SMIv2 consists of the following 3 RFCs which together comprise Internet Standard STD 58.
</p>
<p>	<a class="external" target="wikiext" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2578.txt">RFC 2578</a> - Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).
</p>
<p>   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using an adapted subset of
   OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One, ASN.1 (1988).  It is the
   purpose of this document, the Structure of Management Information
   (SMI), to define that adapted subset, and to assign a set of
   associated administrative values.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>	<a class="external" target="wikiext" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2579.txt">RFC 2579</a> - Textual Conventions for SMIv2.
</p>
<p>   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define new types
   similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison to a type defined
   in the SMI, each of these new types has a different name, a similar
   syntax, but a more precise semantics.  These newly defined types are
   termed textual conventions, and are used for the convenience of
   humans reading the MIB module.  It is the purpose of this document to

<p>The Next Generation Network Management Focus Group (NGNMFG) was created by ITU-T to organize and undertake a unified approach regarding specification of Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security Management interfaces for Next Generation -telecommunication- Networks. A key element in the operation of the FG is that it engages key individuals from various organizations with management expertise and specifications applicable to NGN to collaborate in and contribute to this activity.
</p>
<p>The primary deliverable of the NGNMFG is the NGN Management Specification Roadmap. This document identifies the various existing, or work-in-progress specifications relevant to NGN management. These specifications are not all ITU-T Recommendations, but also come from other standards making bodies with expertise in defining management interfaces. For example, the roadmap tags the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) specs for mobile telephony relevant to the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) management. IMS is expected to be a key building block for NGN.<br />
An additional and important feature of the document is that it provides gap analysis, identifying areas where standards are still needed, and also identifies overlapping specifications requiring harmonization.

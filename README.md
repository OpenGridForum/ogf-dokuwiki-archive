This repository hosts a static converted version of the Open Grid Forum web
historical assets intended for archive purposes. Web content available includes
the following assets, archived in read-only mode. Current active content for
ongoing activities is hosted on the [OpenGridForum organizational pages on GitHub](https://github.com/opengridforum).
Groups wishing to continue OGF work can refer to these historical archives for past activity.

-   [Archived Main Open Grid Forum Dokuwiki Web Site 
    content](https://dokuwiki.ogf.org/)
    (2013 - 2022)
    
    This site supported the front-facing main web content for overall information about OGF
    from 2013 - late 2022, including announcements, event pages, news, organizational information,
    and details about OGF areas, groups, and officers. 
    
-   [Archived OGF Redmine Project Pages content](https://redmine.ogf.org/)
    (2012 - 2022)
    
    This site took over from GridForge as the primary content manager for individual projects and their
    associated community and working groups. It supported repositories for ongoing products of these
    groups as well as action trackers, meeting notes pages, comments, and other day-to-day content.
    This site is now a static archive that includes all documents, meeting notes, drafts, and
    the final versions of the repository content for previous work, including a separately archived
    copy of the older GridForge site content to ensure accessibility of older content
    and to document provenance and historical development of this content.
    
-   [Archived GridForge project pages content](https://forge.ogf.org/sf/sfmain/do/home.html) (2003 - 2013)

    The GridForge site served as the primary content manager for individual projects and their
    associated community and working groups from early in the formation of the Grid Forum through its 
    transition to the Global Grid Forum and eventually the Open Grid Forum. 
    It supported repositories for ongoing products of the associated community and working 
    groups as well as action trackers, meeting notes pages, comments, and other day-to-day content.
    It was replaced in 2013 with the newer Redmine content manager mentioned above, after a short overlap period.
    This archive is included to ensure accessibility of historical content 
    and to document provenance and historical development of this content.
